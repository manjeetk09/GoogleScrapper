Hierarchical Databases In the Hierarchical Database Model we have to learn about the databases.
0.74: (we; have to learn about; the databases)

 It is very fast and simple.
No extractions found.

 In a hierarchical database, records contain information about there groups of parent child relationships, just like as a tree structure.
0.783: (records; contain; information)
0.569: (records; contain information about there groups of parent child relationships in; a hierarchical database)

 The structure implies that a record can have also a repeating information.
0.68: (a record; can have also; a repeating information)

 In this structure Data follows a series of records, It is a set of field values attached to it.
0.893: (It; is a set of; field values attached to it)[enabler=this structure Data follows a series of records]
0.805: (Data; follows; a series of records)
0.636: (Data; follows a series of records in; this structure)
0.628: (field values; be attached to; it)
0.62: (It; is; a set of field values)

 It collects all records together as a record type.
0.785: (It; collects all records together as; a record type)
0.488: (It; collects together; all records)

 These record types are the equivalent of tables in the relational model, and with the individual records being the equivalent of rows.
0.939: (These record types; are the equivalent of; tables)
0.896: (These record types; are the equivalent of tables in; the relational model)
0.82: (the individual records; being the equivalent of; rows)

 To create links between these record types, the hierarchical model uses these type Relationships.
0.591: (the hierarchical model; uses Relationships; these type)
0.562: (these type; be uses Relationships by; links)

Advantage Hierarchical database can be accessed and updated rapidly because in this model structure is like as a tree and the relationships between records are defined in advance.

Disadvantage This type of database structure is that each child in the tree may have only one parent, and relationships or linkages between children are not permitted, even if they make sense from a logical standpoint.
0.157: (they; even make sense from; a logical standpoint)
0.128: (they; even make; sense)

 Hierarchical databases are so in their design.
0.778: (Hierarchical databases; are so in; their design)

 it can adding a new field or record requires that the entire database be redefined.
0.487: (it; can adding; a new field or record)

 Network Database A network databases are mainly used on a large digital computers.
0.926: (Network Database; are mainly used on; a large digital computers)

 It more connections can be made between different types of data, network databases are considered more efficiency It contains limitations must be considered when we have to use this kind of database.
0.917: (more connections; can be made between; different types of data)
0.886: (It; can be made between; different types of data)
0.735: (network databases; are considered; efficiency It contains limitations must be considered when we have to use this kind of database)
0.667: (we; have to use; this kind of database)

 It is Similar to the hierarchical databases, network databases .
0.709: (It; is Similar to; the hierarchical databases)
0.646: (It; is; Similar)

Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases by also having a hierarchical structure.
0.844: (Network databases; are similar to; hierarchical databases)

 A network database looks more like a cobweb or interconnected network of records.
0.864: (A network database; looks like; a cobweb or interconnected network of records)
