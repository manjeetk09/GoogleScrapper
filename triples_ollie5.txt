The tree is one of the most powerful of the advanced data structures and it often pops up in even more advanced subjects such as AI and compiler design.

Whenever you use a database there is a 99% chance that an index is involved somewhere.
0.774: (you; use; a database)

 The simplest type of index is a sorted listing of the key field.
0.93: (The simplest type of index; is a sorted listing of; the key field)
0.778: (The simplest type of index; is; a sorted listing of the key field)
0.492: (a sorted listing of the key field; be The simplest type of; index)

 This provides a fast lookup because you can use a binary search to locate any item without having to look at each one in turn.

Some properties of abstract data types:.
No extractions found.

A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.
0.788: (A data structure; is said; linear)
0.156: (its elements; form; a sequence)

In these data structures each tree node compares a bit slice of key values.
0.825: (each tree node; compares; a bit slice of key values)
0.613: (each tree node; compares a bit slice of key values in; these data structures)

These are data structures used for space partitioning or binary space partitioning.

There are many basic data structures that can be used to solve application problems.
No extractions found.

 Array is a good static data structure that can be accessed randomly and is fairly easy to implement.
0.712: (Array; is; a good static data structure that can be accessed randomly and is fairly easy to implement)

 Linked Lists on the other hand is dynamic and is ideal for application that requires frequent operations such as add, delete, and update.
0.904: (Linked Lists; is ideal for; application that requires frequent operations such as add , delete , and update)
0.777: (Linked Lists; is; dynamic and is ideal)
0.721: (dynamic and is ideal; be Linked Lists on; the other hand)
0.62: (frequent operations; be requires by; application)

 One drawback of linked list is that data access is sequential.
0.598: (data access; is; sequential)

 Then there are other specialized data structures like, stacks and queues that allows us to solve complicated problems using these restricted data structures.
0.643: (us to solve complicated problems; be allows by; stacks and queues)

 One other data structure is the hash table that allows users to program applications that require frequent search and updates.

One of the disadvantages of using an array or linked list to store data is the time necessary to search for an item.
0.746: (One of the disadvantages of using an array or linked list to store data; is; the time necessary)

 Since both the arrays and Linked Lists are linear structures the time required to search a “linear” list is proportional to the size of the data set.
0.613: (list; a "linear " list is proportional to; the size of the data)

 For example, if the size of the data set is n, then the number of comparisons needed to find an item may be as bad as some multiple of n.
0.777: (the number of comparisons; is n , then may be as bad as; some multiple of n)
0.649: (the number of comparisons; is n then may be as; bad)
0.649: (the number of comparisons; is n , then may be as; bad)
0.323: (bad; be the number of; comparisons needed to find an item)
0.159: (the size of the data; is n , then may be as bad as; some multiple of n)
0.123: (bad; be the size of; the data set)
0.091: (the size of the data; is n then may be as; bad)
0.091: (the size of the data; is n , then may be as; bad)

 So imagine doing the search on a linked list with n = 106 nodes.
0.779: (the search; So imagine doing on; a linked list)
0.751: (the search; So imagine doing with; 106 nodes)

 Even on a machine that can do million comparisons per second, searching for m items will take roughly m seconds.
0.577: (m seconds; will be take on; a machine that can do million comparisons per second)

 This not acceptable in today’s world where speed at which we complete operations is extremely important.
0.817: (speed at which we complete operations; is extremely; important)

 Time is money.
0.716: (Time; is; money)

 Therefore it seems that better data structures are needed to store and search data.
0.487: (better data structures; to search; data)

In linear data structure, data is organized in sequential order and in non_linear data structure, data is organized in random order.

 A tree data structure can be defined as follows.
No extractions found.

Tree data structure is a collection of data which is organized in hierarchical structure and this is a recursive definition.
0.953: (Tree data structure; is a collection of; data which is organized in hierarchical structure and this is a recursive definition)
0.724: (Tree data structure; is; a collection of data)

In a normal tree, every node can have any number of children.
0.825: (every node; can have; any number of children)
0.591: (every node; can have any number of children in; a normal tree)
0.553: (every node; be any number of; children)
0.473: (any number of children; can be have in; a normal tree)

 Binary tree is a special type of tree data structure in which every node can have a maximum of 2 children.
0.825: (every node; can have; a maximum of 2 children)
0.553: (every node; be a maximum of; 2 children)
0.451: (a special type of tree data structure in which every node can have a maximum of 2 children; is binary; tree)

 One is known as left child and the other is known as right child.
0.914: (the other; is known as; right child)
0.9: (One; is known as; left child)

In a binary tree, every node can have a maximum of two children.
0.825: (every node; can have; a maximum of two children)
0.591: (every node; can have a maximum of two children in; a binary tree)
0.553: (every node; be a maximum of; two children)
0.473: (a maximum of two children; can be have in; a binary tree)

 But in strictly binary tree, every node should have exactly two children or none and in complete binary tree all the nodes must have exactly two children and at every level of complete binary tree there must be 2level number of nodes.
0.818: (every node; should must be 2level number of nodes at; every level of complete)
0.772: (every node; should must be 2level number of; nodes)
0.717: (all the nodes; must have; exactly two children)
0.531: (every node; should must be; 2level number of nodes)
0.488: (every node; should have must; two children or none and in)

 For example at level 2 there must be 22 = 4 nodes and at level 3 there must be 23 = 8 nodes.

Now that we have studied linear data structures like stacks and queues and have some experience with recursion, we will look at a common data structure called the tree.

 Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical cousins.
0.793: (Tree data structures; have; many things)
0.778: (Tree data structures; have many things in common with; their botanical cousins)

 A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves.
0.692: (A tree data structure; has; a root)

 The difference between a tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data structure has its root at the top and its leaves on the bottom.
0.755: (a tree data structure; has its root at; the top and its leaves)
0.584: (a tree data structure; has; its root)
0.465: (a tree data structure; is in; The difference)

A third property is that each leaf node is unique.
0.583: (each leaf node; is; unique)

 We can specify a path from the root of the tree to a leaf that uniquely identifies each species in the animal kingdom; for example, Animalia \Chordate \Mammal \Carnivora \Felidae \Felis \Domestica.
0.843: (We; can specify a path from; the root of the tree)
