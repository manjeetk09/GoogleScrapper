An algebraic function is a function that involves only algebraic operations, like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as fractional or rational exponents.
0.87: (An algebraic function; is a function like; addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division)
0.698: (An algebraic function; is; a function that involves only algebraic operations)
0.564: (algebraic operations; be involves by; a function)

 Think of an algebraic function as a machine, where real numbers go in, mathematical operations occur, and other numbers come out.

An algebraic function is a function which satisfies , where is a polynomial in and with integer coefficients.
0.653: (An algebraic function; is; a function which satisfies)

 Functions that can be constructed using only a finite number of elementary operations together with the inverses of functions capable of being so constructed are examples of algebraic functions.
0.909: (Functions that can be constructed using only a finite number of elementary operations together with the inverses of functions capable; are examples of; algebraic functions)
0.634: (a finite number of elementary operations; be using together with; the inverses of functions capable)

 Nonalgebraic functions are called transcendental functions.
0.763: (Nonalgebraic functions; are called; transcendental functions)

This function is a well_defined function, since we assume every element  x  in X  is mapped via the function machine to a unique element  y  in X , i.
0.925: (every element x; is mapped via; the function machine)
0.667: (This function; is; a well_defined function)

, every person  x  has exactly one mother  y .
0.576: (every person x; has y; exactly one mother)

 Although the codomain is the set of all people  X , it s clear that it will be impossible for this function to output certain people.
0.861: (the codomain; is the set of; all people)
0.678: (it; will be impossible for; this function)
0.621: (the codomain; is; the set of all people)
0.584: (it; will be impossible to; output certain people)
0.576: (it; will be; impossible)

 There s no way the mother function  m  could output any males, nor could it output any childless females.

 In other words, the range of the function  m  is the set of female people who have had children, which is a proper subset of the set  X  of all people.
0.938: (the range of the function m; is the set of; female people who have had children ,)
0.817: (children; is a proper subset of; the set)
0.794: (the range of the function m; is; the set of female people)
0.746: (the range of the function m; is the set of female people in; other words)
0.399: (the set of female people; be the range of; the function m)

We can also define a function using an algebraic formula, such as  f x 2 1 .
0.64: (We; can also define; a function)
0.512: (We; can also define a function using; an algebraic formula)

 Such algebraic formulas are the way many people think of functions, though, as the above examples show, such a formula is not required.
0.817: (many people; think of; functions)

Okay, with that out of the way let s get back to the definition of a function and let s look at some examples of equations that are functions and equations that aren t functions.
