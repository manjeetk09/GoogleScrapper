The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships.
0.882: (a database model; conceived as; a flexible way representing objects and their relationships)
0.667: (The network model; is; a database model)

 Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.
0.794: (the schema; be viewed as; a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs)

A Database model defines the logical design of data.

 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.

 Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.

In the network model, entities are organised in a graph,in which some entities can be accessed through several path.

The Network model replaces the hierarchical tree with a graph thus allowing more general connections among the nodes.
0.807: (The Network model; replaces; the hierarchical tree)
0.554: (a graph; thus allowing; more general connections)

 The main difference of the network model from the hierarchical model, is its ability to handle many to many  relations.
0.787: (The main difference of the network model; is; its ability to handle many to many relations)
0.754: (many; to handle to be; many relations)
0.714: (its ability to handle many to many relations; be The main difference of; the network model)
0.582: (its ability to handle many to many relations; be The main difference of the network model from; the hierarchical model)

 In other words, it allows a record to have more than one parent.
0.816: (a record; to have; than one parent)
0.496: (it; allows in; other words)

 Suppose an employee works for two departments.
0.875: (an employee; works for; two departments)

 The strict hierarchical arrangement is not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph  a network.
0.733: (The strict hierarchical arrangement; becomes; not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph)
0.596: (The strict hierarchical arrangement; is here; not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph)

 The network model was evolved to specifically handle nonhierarchical relationships.

Considering again the sample supplierpart database, its network view is shown.
0.695: (its network view; is shown in; the sample supplierpart database)

 In addition to the part and supplier record types, a third record type is introduced which we will call as the connector.

0.626: (we; which will call as; the connector)

 A connector occurrence specifies the association  between one supplier and one part.

 It contains data  describing the association between supplier and part records.
