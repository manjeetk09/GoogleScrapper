The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships.
0.882: (a database model; conceived as; a flexible way representing objects and their relationships)
0.667: (The network model; is; a database model)

 Its distinguishing feature is that the schema  viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs  is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.
0.753: (the schema; be viewed as; a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types)

The Network model replaces the hierarchical tree with a graph thus allowing more general connections among the nodes.
0.807: (The Network model; replaces; the hierarchical tree)
0.554: (a graph; thus allowing; more general connections)

 The main difference of the network model from the hierarchical model  is its ability to handle many to many  N N  relations.
0.745: (The main difference of the network model; is; its ability to handle many to many N N relations)
0.708: (many; to handle to be; many N N relations)

0.524: (its ability to handle many to many N N relations; be The main difference of the network model from; the hierarchical model)

 In other words  it allows a record to have more than one parent.
0.816: (a record; to have; than one parent)
0.496: (it; allows in; other words)

 Suppose an employee works for two departments.
0.875: (an employee; works for; two departments)

 The strict hierarchical arrangement is not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph   a network.
0.733: (The strict hierarchical arrangement; becomes; not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph)
0.596: (The strict hierarchical arrangement; is here; not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph)

 The network model was evolved to specifically handle non hierarchical relationships.

Considering again the sample supplier part database  its network view is shown.

 In addition to the part and supplier record types  a third record type is introduced which we will call as the connector.

 A connector occurrence specifies the association  shipment  between one supplier and one part.

 A network is a directed graph consisting of nodes connected by links or directed arcs.

 The nodes corresponds to record types and the links to pointers or relationships.
