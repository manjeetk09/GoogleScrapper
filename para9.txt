Provide concepts that are close to the way people perceive data to present the data. A typical example of this type is the entity relationship model which uses main concepts like entities, attributes, relationships. An entity represents a real-world object such as an employee, a project. An entity has some attributes which represents properties of entity such as employee’s name, address, birthdate. A relationship represents an association among entities, for example an employee works on many projects. The relationship exists between employee and project.

Database systems can be based on different data models or database models respectively. A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database. Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively. The most often used data models are:

A model is a representation of reality, 'real world' objects and events, associations. It is an abstraction that concentrates on the essential, inherent aspects an organization and ignores the accidental properties. A data model represents the organization itself. It should provide the basic concepts and notations that will allow database designers and end users unambiguously and accurately to communicate their understanding of the organizational data.

Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled. Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS. Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.

Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is based on the notion of real-world entities and relationships among them. While formulating real-world scenario into the database model, the ER Model creates entity set, relationship set, general attributes and constraints.
