A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas. The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file. Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships. However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database. Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flat-file databases.

Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a non-relational database. A good example of a flat file is a single text-only file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter.

The flat model is the earliest, simplest data model. It simply lists all the data in a single table, consisting of columns and rows. In order to access or manipulate the data, the computer has to read the entire flat file into memory, which makes this model inefficient for all but the smallest data sets.
