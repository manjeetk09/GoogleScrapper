0;In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables.
0; More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.

0;Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs connected by some points sometimes called  remarkable points .
0; A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis.
0; In each direction, an arc is either unbounded or has an end point which is either a singular point or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

0;This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the  complete  curve.
0; This point of view is commonly expressed by calling  points at infinity  of the affine curve the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.

0;There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
0; Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0; They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0; The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
0;These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves.
0; The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.
0;Algebra is all about graphing relationships, and the curve is one of the most basic shapes used.
0; Here s a look at eight of the most frequently used graphs.
0;The following table lists the names of algebraic curves of a given degree.
0;Curves that can be given in implicit form as f 0, where f is a polynomial, are called algebraic.
0; The degree of f is called the degree or order of the curve.
0; Thus conics are algebraic curves of degree two.
0; Curves of degree three already have a great variety of shapes, and only a few common ones will be given here.
0;More generally, any curve of degree three with equation y f, where f is a polynomial, is symmetric with respect to the x_axis and asymptotic to the line x x.
0; In addition to the cissoid, the following particular cases are important.
0; The witch of Agnesi has equation xy a, with a0, and is characterized by the geometric property shown in Figure 2, right.
0; The same property provides the parametric representation x a, y a tan .
0; Once more, proportional scaling reduces to the case a 1.
0; The folium of Descartes has equation y _x, with a0 .
0; By rotating 135 we get the alternative and more familiar equation x y cxy, where c a.
0; The folium of Descartes is a rational curve, this is, it has a parametric representation by rational functions.
0; In the tilted position such a representation is x ct , y ct .
0;    Figure 3.
0; The folium of Descartes in two positions, and the strophoid.
0; The strophoid has equation y _x, with a0 .
0; It satisfies the property AP AP  OA in Figure 3, right  this means that POP  is a right angle.
0; The strophoid has the polar representation r _a cos 2 sec , and the rational parametric representation x a , y at .
0;Hi, you ve entered a collection of  939 two_dimensional mathematical curves.

0;algebraic curves are a polynomial in x and y.
