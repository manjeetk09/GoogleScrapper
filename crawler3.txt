The following deviations from the relational model have been noted in SQL.
 Note that few database servers implement the entire SQL standard and in particular do not allow some of these deviations.
 Whereas NULL is ubiquitous, for example, allowing duplicate column names within a table or anonymous columns is uncommon.

A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.
 Each table  contains one or more data categories in columns.
 Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.
 For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth.
 Another table would describe an order  product, customer, date, sales price, and so forth.
 A user of the database could obtain a view of the database that fitted the user s needs.
 For example, a branch office manager might like a view or report on all customers that had bought products after a certain date.
 A financial services manager in the same company could, from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that needed to be paid.

Relational database was proposed by Edgar Codd  around 1969.
 It has since become the dominant database model for commercial applications .
 Today, there are many commercial Relational Database Management System , such as Oracle, IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.
 There are also many free and opensource RDBMS, such as MySQL, mSQL  and the embedded JavaDB .

In the relational model, a table cannot contain duplicate rows, because that would create ambiguities in retrieval.
 To ensure uniqueness, each table should have a column , called primary key, that uniquely identifies every records of the table.
 For example, an unique number customerID can be used as the primary key for the Customers table  productCode for Products table  isbn for Books table.
 A primary key is called a simple key if it is a single column  it is called a composite key if it is made up of several columns.
For example,.

The most common relational model is one where a single record in the parenttable relates to multiple records in the child table.
 This is called aonetomany relationship.
 The sales leads example is a onetomanyrelationship because one record in the Companies table can relate to manyrecords in the Contacts table .
 In these models, the  many  table is theone where you add the foreign key.
Another example of a onetomany relationship is an application that tracksaccounts receivable invoices.
 You need one table for the invoice data and another for the customer data .
 In this case, onecustomer can place many orders, so Customers is the parent table, Invoices isthe child table, and the common field is the Customer table s primarykey.

 The  Relational Database Model is the most common model in industry today.
  A relational database is based on the relational model developed by E.
F.
 Codd.
 A relational database allows the definition of data structures, storage and retrieval operations and integrity constraints.
 In such a database the data and relations between them are organized into tables.
 A table is a collection of records and each record in a table contains the same fields.
   The contents of a table can be permanently saved for future use.

Certain fields may be designated as keys, which means that searches for specific values of that field will use indexing to speed them up and more importantly, uniquely identify each entity.
  There are many types of keys, however, quite possibly the two most important are the primary key and the foreign key.
  The primary key is what uniquely identifies each entity.
  The foreign key is a primary key of one table that also sits in another table.
  Ultimately, the use of foreign keys is the heart of the relational database model.
  This linkage that the foreign key provides is what allows tables to pull data from each other and link data together.
  Where fields in two different tables take values from the same set, a join operation can be performed to select related records in the two tables by matching values in those fields.
 Most often, but not always, the fields will have the same name in both tables.
 For example, an  orders  table might contain  pairs and a  products  table might contain  pairs so to calculate a given customer s bill you would sum the prices of all products ordered by that customer by joining on the productcode fields of the two tables.
 This can be extended to joining multiple tables on multiple fields.
 Because these relationships are only specified at retrieval time, relational databases are classed as dynamic database management system.
   Also, another important role of the primary key is called  determination .
  What this means is that if you know the value of attribute X, you can determine the value of attribute Y.
    The relational database model is based on the Relational Algebra.
  Which means that operations in the relational database model are based on Select, Project, Join, Intersect, Union, Difference, and Product.
  Here is a brief description of each operation .
