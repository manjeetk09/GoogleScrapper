We shall not see the implementation of Breadth First Traversal  in C programming language.
 For our reference purpose, we shall follow our example and take this as our graph model  .
Depth First Traversal  for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree.
 The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again.
 To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array.
 For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2.
 When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it.
 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0.
 If we don t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again and it will become a nonterminating process.
 A Depth First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 1, 3.

 For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.
 For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2.
 When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it.
 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0.
 If we don t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again and it will become a nonterminating process.
 A Breadth First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 3, 1.

Breadthfirst search  is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes in the order of their distance from the roots, where distance is defined as the minimum path length from a root to the node.
 Its pseudocode looks like this .
.
.
Clearly, nodes are popped in distance order  A, B, D, E, C.
 This is very useful when we are trying to find the shortest path through the graph to something.
 When a queue is used in this way, it is known as a worklist  it keeps track of work left to be done.
