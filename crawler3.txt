0;AMP stands for Asymmetric Multi_Processing  SMP means Symmetric Multi_Processing.
0; These terms are not at all transparent.
0; In seeking a means to clarify, I thought I would check Wikipedia and looked up  AMP .
0; From the disambiguation page, I found the relevant article.
0; Well, I say  relevant , but it really does not cover the topic as we see it today.
0; It talks about historical uses of multiple CPUs and dismisses it to history.
0; So, I will try to advance definitions.

0;Asymmetric multiprocessing was the only method for handling multiple CPUs before symmetric multiprocessing was available.
0; It has also been used to provide less expensive options on systems where SMP was available.
0; Additionally, AMP is used in applications that are dedicated, such as embedded systems, when individual processors can be dedicated to specific tasks at design time.
0; In an asymmetric multiprocessing system, not all CPUs are treated equally  for example, a system might only allow one CPU to execute operating system code or might only allow one CPU to perform I O operations.
0; Other AMP systems would allow any CPU to execute operating system code and perform I O operations, so that they were symmetric with regard to processor roles, but attached some or all peripherals to particular CPUs, so that they were asymmetric with regard to peripheral attachment.

0;Asymmetric multiprocessing    In asymmetric multiprocessing the program tasks are strictly divided by type between processors and typically, each processor has its own memory address space.
0;  These features make asymmetric multiprocessing difficult to implement.
0; The two figures below are two examples of asymmetric multiprocessor configurations.
0; .
0; Symmetric multiprocessing Symmetric multiprocessing is the most common configuration of multiple processors.
0; A typical SMP configuration has the following items.
0;        It has multiple processors and exactly one of everything else.
0; memory, I O subsystem, operating system, etc.
0;        The processors are symmetric, that is, they can do anything the others can.
0;  Each can look at or alter any element of memory, and each can do any kind of I O.

0;Another difference is that.
0; in a tightly_coupled system, the delay experienced when a message is sent from one computer to another is short, and data rate is high  that is, the number of bits per second that can be transferred is large.
0; In a loosely_coupled system, the opposite is true.
0; the intermachine message delay is large and the data rate is low.
0; For example, two CPU chips on the same printed circuit board and connected by wires etched onto the board are likely to be tightly coupled, whereas two computers connected by a 2400 bit sec modem over the telephone system are certain to be loosely coupled.

0;Or, different OSs may reside on the two cores.
0; For example, if two previously separate processors are being collapsed onto one dual_core device, different OSs may reside on the two cores.
