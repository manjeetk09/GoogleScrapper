Because data structures are higher_level abstractions, they present to us operations on groups of data, such as adding an item to a list, or looking up the highest_priority item in a queue.
 When a data structure provides operations, we can call the data structure an abstract data type .
 Abstract data types can minimize dependencies in your code, which is important when your code needs to be changed.
 Because you are abstracted away from lower_level details, some of the higher_level commonalities one data structure shares with a different data structure can be used to replace one with the other.

In computer science, an abstract data type is a mathematical model for data types where a data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
 This contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

For example, an abstract stack, which is a last_in_first_out structure, could be defined by three operations: push, that inserts a data item onto the stack; pop, that removes a data item from it; and peek or top, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal.
 An abstract queue, which is a first_in_first_out structure, would also have three operations: enqueue, that inserts a data item into the queue; dequeue, that removes the first data item from it; and front, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue.
 There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet.
 When analyzing the efficiency of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
 General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on.
 Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.
 In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms.

In linear data structure, data is organized in sequential order and in non_linear data structure, data is organized in random order.
 Tree is a very popular data structure used in wide range of applications.
 A tree data structure can be defined as follows.
