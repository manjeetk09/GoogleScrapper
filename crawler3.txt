Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.
 The training data consist of a set of training examples.
 In supervised learning  each example is a pair consisting of an input object  typically a vector  and a desired output value  also called the supervisory signal .
 A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function  which can be used for mapping new examples.
 An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.
 This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a  reasonable  way  see inductive bias .

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset  called the training dataset  to make predictions.
 The training dataset includes input data and response values.
 From it  the supervised learning algorithm seeks to build a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset.
 A test dataset is often used to validate the model.
 Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.
