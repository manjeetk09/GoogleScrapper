In the 1960's North American Rockwell together with IBM developed a database processing language called DL/I (Data Language I).  This partnership also produced the IMS (Information Management System) which went on to become the world's leading mainframe hierarchical DBMS of the seventies and eighties.
IMS uses DL/I to process its database.
DL/I uses hierarchies (or trees) to represent relationships.






In figure 1, the node at level 1 is called the root node and the nodes at that has no children are called leaves. For example, node 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Nodes that are children of the same parent are called siblings. For example, nodes 2, 3, 4 are siblings.
For any node there is a single path called the hierarchical path from the root node. The nodes along this path are called that nodes ancestors.
Similarly for a given node, any node along a path from that node to leaf is called its descendent.
For example, suppose we have to find out the hierarchical path of node 10, then it will be 1→2→6→10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1, 2 and 6.
The height of tree is the number of levels on the longest hierarchical path from the root to a leaf. The above tree has a height= 4.
A tree is said to be balanced if every path from the root node to a leaf has the same length.
