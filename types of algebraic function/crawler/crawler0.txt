0;Amy has a master s degree in secondary education and has taught math at a public charter high school.
0;There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
0; Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0; They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0; The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
0;Linear graphs are produced by linear functions of this form.
0;Linear functions have variables to the first degree and have two constants that determine the location of the graph.
0; These functions always graph into a line.
0; The constant m determines whether the line slopes down or up.
0; If it is positive, the line will slope up, and if it is negative, then the line will slope down.
0;Power graphs are produced by functions with only one term and a power.
0; The power can be positive, negative, or even a fraction.
0;The graphs that these types of functions produce vary depending on the power.
0; If the power is positive, the graph changes direction based on the number of the power.
0; If the power is even, the graph will have both edges going in the same direction.
0; If the power is odd, the graph will have one edge going up and another going down.
0; If the power is negative, it will have two parts.
0; Each part will avoid the x 0 line because that will cause division by zero.
0; When the power is a fraction, the graph goes up at x 0 and then when y is positive, it starts curving towards the x_axis.
0;Quadratics are functions where the highest power is two.
0;They graph into parabolas.
0; The constants a, b, and c determine the location of the parabola on the graph.
0; The a tells you whether the parabola will open up or down.
0; If it s positive, it will open up and smile.
0; If it s negative, it will open down and frown.
0;Polynomials are a more general function than a quadratic and allow for higher powers that are still whole numbers.
0;These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves.
0; The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.
0;Rational graphs are from functions that are the division of two polynomials.
0; When these are graphed, you will see the graph split into parts.
0; The areas that the graph avoids are where division by zero happens.
0;Exponentials are where the x variable is the power.

0;When b is greater than one, then you will see exponential growth occur.
0; If it is less than one but greater than zero, you will see exponential decay.
0; Growth is when the graph rises to the right.
0; Decay is when it drops to the right.
0;Logarithmic functions involve the graphing of logarithms.
0;These graphs are similar to the exponentials except they rise earlier and grow slower.
0;Sinusoidal graphs use functions that have the sine function inside.
0;The graph shows up as a wave pattern.
0;Different types of graphs depend on the type of function that is graphed.
0; The eight most commonly used graphs are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
0; Each has a unique graph that is easy to visually differentiate from the rest.
0;You might see other types of graphs that aren t listed here.
0; That s because there are many different types of functions, and the more you continue learning math, the more you will get exposed to.
0; What you have learned in this lesson is a good beginning framework for the types of graphs you will see.
0;After you have finished this lesson, you should be able to name and identify the eight most commonly used graphs.
