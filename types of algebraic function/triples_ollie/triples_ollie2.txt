In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables.
0.936: (a plane real algebraic curve; is the set of; points)
0.932: (whose coordinates; are zeros of; some polynomial)
0.906: (whose coordinates; are zeros of some polynomial in; two variables)
0.794: (a plane real algebraic curve; is; the set of points)
0.746: (a plane real algebraic curve; is the set of points in; mathematics)

 More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.
0.652: (an algebraic curve; More generally is; similar)

Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs connected by some points sometimes called  remarkable points .
0.87: (Every algebraic curve; may be uniquely decomposed remarkable points into; a finite number of smooth monotone arcs)
0.655: (smooth monotone arcs; be connected by; some points)
0.619: (Every algebraic curve; may be uniquely decomposed; remarkable points)

 A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis.
0.953: (A smooth monotone arc; is the graph of; a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis)
0.736: (A smooth monotone arc; is; the graph of a smooth function)
0.53: (a smooth function which is defined; be monotone on; an open interval of the x_axis)

 In each direction, an arc is either unbounded or has an end point which is either a singular point or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.
0.653: (an arc; is; unbounded)
0.48: (an arc; is unbounded in; each direction)

This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the  complete  curve.
0.926: (the affine curve; is a part of; the projective curve that is large enough to well define the complete curve)
0.621: (the affine curve; is; a part of the projective curve)

 This point of view is commonly expressed by calling  points at infinity  of the affine curve the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.
0.437: (points; calling the points of the projective completion that do not belong to be the affine part at; infinity of the affine curve)
0.436: (the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part; be calling points at; infinity of the affine curve)
