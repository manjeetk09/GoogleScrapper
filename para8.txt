In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree. We should always remember that every node may represent a subtree itself.
In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree. We should always remember that every node may represent a subtree itself.
If a binary tree is traversed in-order, the output will produce sorted key values in an ascending order.
In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree.


These searches are referred to as depth-first search (DFS), as the search tree is deepened as much as possible on each child before going to the next sibling. For a binary tree, they are defined as display operations recursively at each node, starting with the root, whose algorithm is as follows:

Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. Following are the generally used ways for traversing trees.

Displaying (or) visiting order of nodes in a binary tree is called as Binary Tree Traversal.
There are three types of binary tree traversals.
Now that we have examined the basic functionality of our tree data structure, it is time to look at some additional usage patterns for trees. These usage patterns can be divided into the three ways that we access the nodes of the tree. There are three commonly used patterns to visit all the nodes in a tree. The difference between these patterns is the order in which each node is visited. We call this visitation of the nodes a “traversal.” The three traversals we will look at are called preorder, inorder, and postorder. Let’s start out by defining these three traversals more carefully, then look at some examples where these patterns are useful.

Let’s look at some examples that illustrate each of these three kinds of traversals. First let’s look at the preorder traversal. As an example of a tree to traverse, we will represent this book as a tree. The book is the root of the tree, and each chapter is a child of the root. Each section within a chapter is a child of the chapter, and each subsection is a child of its section, and so on. Figure 5 shows a limited version of a book with only two chapters. Note that the traversal algorithm works for trees with any number of children, but we will stick with binary trees for now.

Traversing a tree in breadth-first order means that after visiting a node X, all of X's children are visited, then all of X's 'grand-children' (i.e. the children's children), then all of X's 'great-grand-children', etc. In other words, the tree is traversed by sweeping through the breadth of a level before visiting the next level down, as shown in this animation:

What I've just called ``scanning through'' a tree is actually called traversing a tree.






For a specific data structure, we talk about the different orders in which it might be traversed. For a list there are two common traversal orders: first-to-last (the most common) and last-to-first.

If you know that the tree has an inherent sequence in the nodes, and you want to flatten the tree back into its original sequence, than an in-order traversal should be used. The tree would be flattened in the same way it was created. A pre-order or post-order traversal might not unwind the tree back into the sequence which was used to create it.

General Definition: to traverse a tree data structure is to process, however you like, every node in the data structure exactly once.

For a specific tree data structure, we have different orders in which they might be traversed. So for the list abstract data structure there were two common traversal orders: first-to-last (the most common) and last-to-first. This traversal method is applicable to all linear data structures. So now let us consider each approach on a sample binary tree. In the example tree the nodes are numbered in the order that they will be processed. We start off with the pre-order traversal.
