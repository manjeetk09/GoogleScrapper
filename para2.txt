Database design is a process of modeling an enterprise in the real world. In fact, a database itself is a model of the real world that contains selected information needed by the enterprise. Many models and languages—some formally and mathematically defined, some informal and intuitive—are used by designers. Here are the ones that we present in this tutorial:

High-level Conceptual Data models

Relational database was proposed by Edgar Codd (of IBM Research) around 1969. It has since become the dominant database model for commercial applications (in comparison with other database models such as hierarchical, network and object models). Today, there are many commercial Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), such as Oracle, IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server. There are also many free and open-source RDBMS, such as MySQL, mSQL (mini-SQL) and the embedded JavaDB (Apache Derby).

In the relational model, a table cannot contain duplicate rows, because that would create ambiguities in retrieval. To ensure uniqueness, each table should have a column (or a set of columns), called primary key, that uniquely identifies every records of the table. For example, an unique number customerID can be used as the primary key for the Customers table; productCode for Products table; isbn for Books table. A primary key is called a simple key if it is a single column; it is called a composite key if it is made up of several columns.

A Database model defines the logical design of data. The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data. Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used. They are,
