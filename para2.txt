Solution to Question 1:










Think back to when you were in elementary school. Your teacher gave you worksheets containing statements like " + 2 = 4" and told you to fill in the box. Once you got older, your teacher started giving you worksheets containing statements like "x + 2 = 4" and told you to "solve for x".
