In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables. More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.

Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs (also called branches) connected by some points sometimes called "remarkable points". A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x-axis. In each direction, an arc is either unbounded (usually called an infinite arc) or has an end point which is either a singular point (this will be defined below) or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the "complete" curve. This point of view is commonly expressed by calling "points at infinity" of the affine curve the points (in finite number) of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.

There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types. Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs. They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function. The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.

These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves. The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.

The problem of classifying smooth projective curves of a given type can be reduced to the study of discrete groups of transformations of the universal coverings which act freely with a relatively compact fundamental domain. In the case of the projective line, is the identity group; in the case of the affine straight line, is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group which is a two-dimensional lattice in ; in the case of the interior of the unit disc, is a subgroup of motions in the Lobachevskii plane which can be defined by some non-Euclidean bounded polygon. Thus, the first class above contains a unique curve , the second class consists of complex tori that all have the structure of a one-dimensional Abelian variety (elliptic curve), the addition of points on the torus defining the group structure on the respective curve. All smooth elliptic curves are obtained in this way. The field of rational functions on an elliptic curve is isomorphic to the field of meromorphic doubly-periodic (elliptic) functions with period group . If is the equation of the affine model of the curve , then there exists a parametrization , by elliptic functions of it (a uniformization of ). The third class consists of all smooth projective curves of genus . In this case the field is isomorphic to the field of meromorphic functions on that are invariant with respect to the group . Such functions are known as automorphic. Every algebraic curve of genus is uniformized by automorphic functions (cf. Uniformization). The problem of the classification of elliptic curves also led to a study of the quotient , but this situation is substantially different from the one just discussed. First, the group has fixed points in ; secondly, the manifold is non-compact, though containing a finite Lobachevskii plane. The study of the general case of such groups, and of the respective quotients, plays an important role in modern arithmetical research.

The study of the general case of such groups, and of the respective quotients, plays an important role in modern arithmetical research.
The problem of classifying smooth projective curves of a given type can be reduced to the study of discrete groups of transformations of the universal coverings which act freely with a relatively compact fundamental domain. In the case of the projective line, is the identity group; in the case of the affine straight line, is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group which is a two-dimensional lattice in ; in the case of the interior of the unit disc, is a subgroup of motions in the Lobachevskii plane which can be defined by some non-Euclidean bounded polygon. Thus, the first class above contains a unique curve , the second class consists of complex tori that all have the structure of a one-dimensional Abelian variety (elliptic curve), the addition of points on the torus defining the group structure on the respective curve. All smooth elliptic curves are obtained in this way. The field of rational functions on an elliptic curve is isomorphic to the field of meromorphic doubly-periodic (elliptic) functions with period group . If is the equation of the affine model of the curve , then there exists a parametrization , by elliptic functions of it (a uniformization of ). The third class consists of all smooth projective curves of genus . In this case the field is isomorphic to the field of meromorphic functions on that are invariant with respect to the group . Such functions are known as automorphic. Every algebraic curve of genus is uniformized by automorphic functions (cf. Uniformization). The problem of the classification of elliptic curves also led to a study of the quotient , but this situation is substantially different from the one just discussed.
