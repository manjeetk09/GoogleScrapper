A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.

A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.
A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row (or tuple) in the relational database model and an entity type corresponds to a table (or relation).
The hierarchical database model mandates that each child record has only one parent, whereas each parent record can have one or more child records. In order to retrieve data from a hierarchical database the whole tree needs to be traversed starting from the root node. This model is recognized as the first database model created by IBM in the 1960s.

The hierarchical structure was developed by IBM in the 1960s, and used in early mainframe DBMS. Records' relationships form a treelike model. This structure is simple but inflexible because the relationship is confined to a one-to-many relationship. The IBM Information Management System (IMS) and the RDM Mobile are examples of a hierarchical database system with multiple hierarchies over the same data. RDM Mobile is a newly designed embedded database for a mobile computer system.

The hierarchical data model lost traction as Codd's relational model became the de facto standard used by virtually all mainstream database management systems. A relational-database implementation of a hierarchical model was first discussed in published form in 1992 (see also nested set model). Hierarchical data organization schemes resurfaced with the advent of XML in the late 1990s (see also XML database). The hierarchical structure is used primarily today for storing geographic information and file systems.

Currently hierarchical databases are still widely used especially in applications that require very high performance and availability such as banking and telecommunications. One of the most widely used commercial hierarchical databases is IMS. Another example of the use of hierarchical databases is Windows Registry in the Microsoft Windows operating systems.

An organization could store employee information in a table that contains attributes/columns such as employee number, first name, last name, and department number. The organization provides each employee with computer hardware as needed, but computer equipment may only be used by the employee to which it is assigned. The organization could store the computer hardware information in a separate table that includes each part's serial number, type, and the employee that uses it. The tables might look like this:

In this model, the employee data table represents the "parent" part of the hierarchy, while the computer table represents the "child" part of the hierarchy. In contrast to tree structures usually found in computer software algorithms, in this model the children point to the parents. As shown, each employee may possess several pieces of computer equipment, but each individual piece of computer equipment may have only one employee owner.

Consider the following structure:
In this, the "child" is the same type as the "parent". The hierarchy stating EmpNo 10 is boss of 20, and 30 and 40 each report to 20 is represented by the "ReportsTo" column. In Relational database terms, the ReportsTo column is a foreign key referencing the EmpNo column. If the "child" data type were different, it would be in a different table, but there would still be a foreign key referencing the EmpNo column of the employees table.

This simple model is commonly known as the adjacency list model, and was introduced by Dr. Edgar F. Codd after initial criticisms surfaced that the relational model could not model hierarchical data.

The hierarchical structure was developed by IBM in the 1960s, and used in early mainframe DBMS. Records' relationships form a treelike model. This structure is simple but inflexible because the relationship is confined to a one-to-many relationship. The IBM Information Management System (IMS) and the RDM Mobile are examples of a hierarchical database system with multiple hierarchies over the same data. RDM Mobile is a newly designed embedded database for a mobile computer system.

The hierarchical model was the first database model developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional file system.  Hierarchical databases were predominantly used for transaction processing where the volume of transactions is large and the transaction operations change little over time.  For example, the hierarchical database model was particularly popular with banks, because, the way in which banks process savings transactions seldom varies.

In figure 1, the node at level 1 is called the root node and the nodes at that has no children are called leaves. For example, node 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Nodes that are children of the same parent are called siblings. For example, nodes 2, 3, 4 are siblings. For any node there is a single path called the hierarchical path from the root node. The nodes along this path are called that nodes ancestors. Similarly for a given node, any node along a path from that node to leaf is called its descendent. For example, suppose we have to find out the hierarchical path of node 10, then it will be 1→2→6→10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1, 2 and 6. The height of tree is the number of levels on the longest hierarchical path from the root to a leaf. The above tree has a height= 4. A tree is said to be balanced if every path from the root node to a leaf has the same length.

The nodes along this path are called that nodes ancestors. Similarly for a given node, any node along a path from that node to leaf is called its descendent. For example, suppose we have to find out the hierarchical path of node 10, then it will be 1→2→6→10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1, 2 and 6. The height of tree is the number of levels on the longest hierarchical path from the root to a leaf. The above tree has a height= 4. A tree is said to be balanced if every path from the root node to a leaf has the same length.
In figure 1, the node at level 1 is called the root node and the nodes at that has no children are called leaves. For example, node 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Nodes that are children of the same parent are called siblings. For example, nodes 2, 3, 4 are siblings. For any node there is a single path called the hierarchical path from the root node. The nodes along this path are called that nodes ancestors. Similarly for a given node, any node along a path from that node to leaf is called its descendent. For example, suppose we have to find out the hierarchical path of node 10, then it will be 1→2→6→10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1, 2 and 6.

Hierarchical database model is a structure of data organized in a tree-like model using parent/child like relationships, therefore there won't be too many relationships. In a hierarchical database, an entity type can be either a parent or a child; under each individual entity is is more multiple entities. Entity types are related to each other using tree mapping, which is represented by one parent with many child relationships. There are also attributes of a specific data recorded under an entity.

The tree like structure can be repeated data, usually with many children under single parent information. Data is a series of records, which have a set of values within it. All of the collected data is recorded in each type. These types are equal to the tables in other database model, and each parent or child is the equivalent of a row or column in a database table. In a hierarchical model, Parent/Child relationships are all link together by certain types of data in a category. The links are mapped in the relationships so it would look like a tree structure with many branches sprouting form many branches. For example, a company will store information about an employee. So in the beginning of the tree will be the employee name. Below the name will be the data of the employee’s number, department, salary, etc. Information such as birthday, children, and age will be stored also.
