An algebraic function is a function that involves only algebraic operations, like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as fractional or rational exponents.
 Think of an algebraic function as a machine, where real numbers go in, mathematical operations occur, and other numbers come out.

An algebraic function is a function which satisfies , where is a polynomial in and with integer coefficients.
 Functions that can be constructed using only a finite number of elementary operations together with the inverses of functions capable of being so constructed are examples of algebraic functions.
 Nonalgebraic functions are called transcendental functions.
This function is a well_defined function, since we assume every element  x  in X  is mapped via the function machine to a unique element  y  in X , i.
e.
, every person  x  has exactly one mother  y .
 Although the codomain is the set of all people  X , it s clear that it will be impossible for this function to output certain people.
 There s no way the mother function  m  could output any males, nor could it output any childless females.
 In other words, the range of the function  m  is the set of female people who have had children, which is a proper subset of the set  X  of all people.
We can also define a function using an algebraic formula, such as  f x 2 1 .
 Such algebraic formulas are the way many people think of functions, though, as the above examples show, such a formula is not required.
              .
                   .
Okay, with that out of the way let s get back to the definition of a function and let s look at some examples of equations that are functions and equations that aren t functions.
