Many Eclipse perspectives, e g  the Java Development Tools , 1  provide a debugger front_end .
Allinea DDT _ a graphical debugger supporting for parallel multi_process and multithreaded applications, for C   C   and F90 .
DDD is the standard front_end from the GNU Project  It is a complex tool that works with most common debuggers natively or with some external programs  .
GDB GUI Emacs   Emacs editor with built_in support for the GNU Debugger acts as the frontend  KDbg   Part of the KDE development tools  Nemiver   A GDB frontend that integrates well in the GNOME desktop environment  xxgdb   X_window frontend for GDB and dbx debugger  Qt Creator   multi_platform frontend for GDB, CDB and LLDB  Allinea s DDT   a parallel and distributed front_end to a modified version of GDB  Xcode   contains a GDB front_end as well  SlickEdit   contains a GDB front_end as well  Eclipse C C   Development Tools  2    includes visual debugging tools based on GDB  CodeLite   An open source, cross platform C C   IDE which have front end for gdb, the next version of CodeLite will also include a front end to the LLDB CodeBlocks   A free cross_platform C, C   and Fortran IDE with a front end for gdb  RR   An open source C C   debugger by Mozilla, supporting reproduction of program state and reverse execution.

Nemiver   A GDB frontend that integrates well in the GNOME desktop environment .
xxgdb   X_window frontend for GDB and dbx debugger .

Allinea s DDT   a parallel and distributed front_end to a modified version of GDB .
Xcode   contains a GDB front_end as well .
SlickEdit   contains a GDB front_end as well .
Eclipse C C   Development Tools  2    includes visual debugging tools based on GDB .
CodeLite   An open source, cross platform C C   IDE which have front end for gdb, the next version of CodeLite will also include a front end to the LLDB .

The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running Linux kernel on the source level with gdb.
 With KGDB, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs.
 It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code and observe variables.
 On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed.
 KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a serial cable or Ethernet.
 On FreeBSD, it is also possible to debug using Firewire direct memory access .

This article examines three different types of debuggers.
 source_level debuggers, memory debuggers and bug tracking software.
To provide an insight into the quality of software that is available, we have compiled a list of 9 advanced Linux debugging tools.
 Hopefully, there will be something of interest here for anyone who wants to fix, and help fix, bugs.
Here are some free third_party tutorials on the Web.
 There s an article on DDD in Dr.
 Dobb s Journal.
 Linux Magazin has articles on debugging with GDB and DDD.
 LinuxFocus has a DDD tutorial in English, Spanish, German, French, Korean, and Turkish.
