The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.

What is a Database Model?
                A database model is a structure or a format of a database.
Network Database Model
 Network Database Model
A Database model defines the logical design of data. The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data. Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used. They are, Hierarchical Model. Network Model. Relational Model.

In the network model, entities are organised in a graph,in which some entities can be accessed through several path
     
The Network model replaces the hierarchical tree with a graph thus allowing more general connections among the nodes. The main difference of the network model from the hierarchical model, is its ability to handle many to many (N:N) relations. In other words, it allows a record to have more than one parent. Suppose an employee works for two departments. The strict hierarchical arrangement is not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph - a network. The network model was evolved to specifically handle non-hierarchical relationships. As shown below data can belong to more than one parent. Note that there are lateral connections as well as top-down connections. A network structure thus allows 1:1 (one: one), l: M (one: many), M: M (many: many) relationships among entities.

Considering again the sample supplier-part database, its network view is shown. In addition to the part and supplier record types, a third record type is introduced which we will call as the connector. A connector occurrence specifies the association (shipment) between one supplier and one part. It contains data (quantity of the parts supplied) describing the association between supplier and part records.

The network database or network model uses the plex structure as its basic data structure. A network is a directed graph consisting of nodes connected by links or directed arcs. The nodes corresponds to record types and the links to pointers or relationships. All the relationship are hardwired or pre-computed and build into structure of database itself because they are very efficient in space utilization and query execution time. The network data structure looks like a tree structure except that a dependent node which is  called a child or member, may have more than one parent or owner node.All figure shows the network model –

A database model shows the logical structure of a database, including the relationships and constraints that determine how data can be stored and accessed. Individual database models are designed based on the rules and concepts of whichever broader data model the designers adopt. Most data models can be represented by an accompanying database diagram.

The model also accounts for the types of relationships between those tables, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. Here’s an example:
