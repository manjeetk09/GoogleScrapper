There are many kinds of data models. Some of the most common ones include: Hierarchical database model. Relational model. Network model. Object-oriented database model. Entity-relationship model. Document model. Entity-attribute-value model. Star schema. The object-relational model, which combines the two that make up its name.

A Database model defines the logical design of data. The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data. Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used. They are, Hierarchical Model. Network Model. Relational Model.

High-level Conceptual Data models

Database systems can be based on different data models or database models respectively. A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database. Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively. The most often used data models are:

Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled. Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS. Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.

Entity − An entity in an ER Model is a real-world entity having properties called attributes. Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain. For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity. Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc.

Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities. Mapping cardinalities − one to one one to many many to one many to many

In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments. The record structure and some sample records for supplier, parts and shipments elements are as given in following tables.

A database model is primarily a type of data model. Depending on the model in use, a database model can include entities, their relationships, data flow, tables and more. For example, within a hierarchal database mode, the data model organizes data in the form of a tree-like structure having parent and child segments.
