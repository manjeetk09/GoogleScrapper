A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas. The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file. Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships. However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database. Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flat-file databases.

The flat model is the earliest, simplest data model. It simply lists all the data in a single table, consisting of columns and rows. In order to access or manipulate the data, the computer has to read the entire flat file into memory, which makes this model inefficient for all but the smallest data sets.

Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a non-relational database. A good example of a flat file is a single text-only file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter.

A flat file database is a database designed around a single table. The flat file design puts all database information in one table, or list, with fields to represent all parameters. A flat file may contain many fields, often, with duplicate data that are prone to data corruption. If you decide to merge data between two flat files, you need to copy and paste relevant information from one file to the other. There is no automation between flat files. If you have two or more flat files that contain client addresses, for example, and a client moved, you would have to manually modify the address parameters in each file that contains that client’s information. Changing information in one file has no bearing on other files. Flat files offer the functionality to store information, manipulate fields, print or display formatted information and exchange information with others, through email and over the Internet. Some flat files may be attached to external files, such as text editors, to extend functionality and manage related information.

Designing flat file databases is simple and requires little design knowledge. Flat files can be developed using just about any database engine. Flat files can be created in relational database engines by not taking advantage of relational design concepts. Designing a relational database takes more planning than flat file databases. With flat files, you may add information, as you deem necessary. With relational databases, you must be careful to store data in tables such that the relationships make sense. Building a relational database is dependant upon your ability to establish a relational model. The model must fully describe how the data is organized, in terms of data structure, integrity, querying, manipulation and storage.
