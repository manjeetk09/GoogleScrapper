A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.
0.924: (A relational database; is a set of; tables containing data)
0.793: (data; be fitted into; predefined categories)
0.736: (A relational database; is; a set of tables)

 Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.
0.807: (Each table; contains; one or more data categories)

 Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.
0.854: (Each row; contains; a unique instance of data)
0.705: (the categories; be defined by; the columns)

 For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth.
0.837: (a typical business order entry database; would include; a table that described a customer with columns for name , address , phone number , and so forth)
0.754: (a customer; be described with; columns)

The most common relational model is one where a single record in the parenttable relates to multiple records in the child table.
0.667: (The most common relational model; is; one)

 This is called aone_to_many relationship.
No extractions found.

 The sales leads example is a one_to_manyrelationship because one record in the Companies table can relate to manyrecords in the Contacts table .
0.785: (one record; can relate to; manyrecords)
0.687: (The sales leads example; is; a one_to_manyrelationship)

 In these models, the  many  table is theone where you add the foreign key.
0.773: (you; add; the foreign key)

Another example of a one_to_many relationship is an application that tracksaccounts_ receivable invoices.
0.746: (Another example of a one_to_many relationship; is; an application)
0.605: (tracksaccounts;  ; receivable invoices)
0.492: (an application; be Another example of; a one_to_many relationship)

 You need one table for the invoice dataand another for the customer data .
0.842: (You; need; one table)

 In this case, onecustomer can place many orders, so Customers is the parent table, Invoices isthe child table, and the common field is the Customer table s primarykey.
0.729: (onecustomer; can place; many orders)
0.689: (Invoices; isthe; child table)
0.62: (Customers; is; the parent table , Invoices isthe child table , and the common field)
0.591: (onecustomer; can place many orders in; this case)
0.585: (the parent table , Invoices isthe child table , and the common field; is; the Customer table)
0.473: (many orders; can be place in; this case)
