Database design is a process of modeling an enterprise in the real world.
0.792: (Database design; is; a process modeling an enterprise in the real world)
0.674: (an enterprise; be modeling in; the real world)

 In fact, a database itself is a model of the real world that contains selected information needed by the enterprise.
0.909: (a database; is a model of; the real world)
0.782: (selected information; be needed by; the enterprise)
0.752: (a database; is; a model of the real world that contains selected information)
0.628: (selected information needed by the enterprise; be contains by; a model of the real world)
0.446: (a database; is a model of the real world in; fact)

 Many models and languages some formally and mathematically defined, some informal and intuitive are used by designers.
