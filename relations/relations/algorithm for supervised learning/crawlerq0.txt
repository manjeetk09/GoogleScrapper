Supervised learning is where you have input variables and an output variable and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
The most widely used learning algorithms are Support Vector Machines, linear regression, logistic regression, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, k_nearest neighbor algorithm, and Neural Networks .

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset to make predictions.
 The training dataset includes input data and response values.
 From it, the supervised learning algorithm seeks to build a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset.
 A test dataset is often used to validate the model.
 Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.

In the data science course that I instruct, we cover most of the data science pipeline but focus especially on machine learning.
 Besides teaching model evaluation procedures and metrics, we obviously teach the algorithms themselves, primarily for supervised learning.
