A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas.
0.927: (each database; is represented as; a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data ,)
0.825: (A flat database; is; a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table)
0.655: (each database; is represented in; a simple database system)

 The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file.
0.898: (The table; be physically represented as; a simple text file)

 Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships.
0.883: (they; are not unsuitable for; most software applications)
0.761: (they; are not unsuitable of; the limitations of flat databases)

 However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database.
0.739: (some application developers; However still use; flat files)

 Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flat_file databases.
0.892: (Flat databases; are also sometimes referred as; flat_file databases)

The flat model is the earliest, simplest data model.

 It simply lists all the data in a single table, consisting of columns and rows.

0.767: (It; simply lists; the data)
0.642: (It; simply lists all the data consisting of; columns and rows)

 In order to access or manipulate the data, the computer has to read the entire flat file into memory, which makes this model inefficient for all but the smallest data sets.

Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a non_relational database.
No extractions found.

 A good example of a flat file is a single text_only file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter.
0.86: (all the data; be needed for; a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter)

A flat file database is a database designed around a single table.
0.802: (A flat file database; is; a database designed around a single table)
0.793: (a database; be designed around; a single table)

 The flat file design puts all database information in one table, or list, with fields to represent all parameters.
0.841: (The flat file design; puts all database information with; fields)
0.823: (The flat file design; puts all database information in; one table)
0.768: (The flat file design; puts; all database information)
0.659: (The flat file design; puts all database information to represent; all parameters)

 A flat file may contain many fields, often, with duplicate data that are prone to data corruption.
0.741: (A flat file; may contain; many fields)
0.614: (A flat file; be many fields often with; duplicate data that are prone to data corruption)

 If you decide to merge data between two flat files, you need to copy and paste relevant information from one file to the other.
0.8: (you; need to paste relevant information from; one file)[enabler=If you decide to merge data between two flat files]
0.774: (you; need to paste relevant information to; the other)[enabler=If you decide to merge data between two flat files]
0.739: (relevant information; to be paste from; one file)
0.73: (you; need to paste; relevant information)[enabler=If you decide to merge data between two flat files]
0.708: (relevant information; to paste to be; the other)
0.215: (you; decide to merge; data)

 There is no automation between flat files.

 If you have two or more flat files that contain client addresses, for example, and a client moved, you would have to manually modify the address parameters in each file that contains that client s information.
0.891: (you; would have to manually modify the address parameters in; each file)
0.846: (you; would have to manually modify; the address parameters)

0.679: (the address parameters; to be manually modify in; each file)
0.139: (you; have; two or more flat files that contain client addresses)

 Changing information in one file has no bearing on other files.
0.752: (information; be Changing in; one file)

 Flat files offer the functionality to store information, manipulate fields, print or display formatted information and exchange information with others, through email and over the Internet.
0.833: (Flat files; offer; the functionality to store information , manipulate fields , print or display formatted information and exchange information with others)
0.779: (fields , print or display formatted information and exchange information; be manipulate with; others)

0.68: (Flat files; offer the functionality to store information , manipulate fields , print or display formatted information and exchange information with others through; email and over the Internet)

 Some flat files may be attached to external files, such as text editors, to extend functionality and manage related information.
0.9: (Some flat files; may be attached to; external files)
0.22: (external; files as; text editors)

Designing flat file databases is simple and requires little design knowledge.

 Flat files can be created in relational database engines by not taking advantage of relational design concepts.
0.929: (Flat files; can be created in; relational database engines)

 Designing a relational database takes more planning than flat file databases.
0.824: (a relational database; takes; more planning)

 With flat files, you may add information, as you deem necessary.

 With relational databases, you must be careful to store data in tables such that the relationships make sense.

0.659: (tables; make; sense)
0.659: (the relationships; make; sense)

 Building a relational database is dependant upon your ability to establish a relational model.
0.872: (a relational database; is dependant upon; your ability to establish a relational model)
0.778: (a relational database; is; dependant)

 The model must fully describe how the data is organized, in terms of data structure, integrity, querying, manipulation and storage.
