Strictly  a flat file database should consist of nothing but data and  if records vary in length  delimiters.
0.793: (a flat file database; Strictly should consist of; nothing)
0.711: (a flat file database; should vary in; length delimiters)
0.118: (records; should vary in; length delimiters)
0.092: (records; Strictly should consist of; nothing)

 More broadly  the term refers to any database which exists in a single file in the form of rows and columns  with no relationships or links between records and fields except the table structure.
0.874: (the term; More broadly refers to; any database which exists in a single file in the form of rows and columns with no relationships or links between records and fields except the table structure)
0.767: (any database; exists in; a single file)
0.757: (any database; exists in; the form of rows)

The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure  allowing many to many relationships in a tree like structure that allows multiple parents.
0.823: (The network model; expands upon; the hierarchical structure)
0.655: (multiple parents; be allows by; a tree)
0.571: (The network model; expands allowing; many)

 It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model  and is defined by the CODASYL specification.
0.649: (It; was; popular)
0.602: (It; is defined by; the CODASYL specification)

A set consists of circular linked lists where one record type  the set owner or parent  appears once in each circle  and a second record type  the subordinate or child  may appear multiple times in each circle.
0.911: (the subordinate or child; may appear multiple times in; each circle)
0.851: (A set; consists of; circular linked lists)
0.814: (the set owner or parent; appears once in; each circle)
0.778: (the subordinate or child; may appear; multiple times)

 In this way a hierarchy may be established between any two record types  e.
0.914: (a hierarchy; may be established between; any two record types e)
0.754: (a hierarchy; may be established in; this way)

  type A is the owner of B.
No extractions found.

 At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A.
0.858: (B; is the owner of; A.)
0.754: (another set; may be defined at; the same time)
0.619: (B; is; the owner of A.)

 Thus all the sets comprise a general directed graph  ownership defines a direction   or network construct.

A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data  which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas.
0.931: (each database; is represented as; a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data)
0.825: (A flat database; is; a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table)
0.655: (each database; is represented in; a simple database system)

 The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file.
0.898: (The table; be physically represented as; a simple text file)

 Because of the limitations of flat databases  they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships.
0.883: (they; are not unsuitable for; most software applications)
0.577: (a need to represent and store complex business relationships; is of; the limitations of flat databases)

 However  some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database.
0.783: (some application developers; still use; flat files)

 Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flat file databases.
0.892: (Flat databases; are also sometimes referred as; flat file databases)
