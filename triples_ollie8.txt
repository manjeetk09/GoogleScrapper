Strictly, a flat file database should consist of nothing but data and, if records vary in length, delimiters.
0.793: (a flat file database; Strictly should consist of; nothing)
0.162: (records; vary in; length)

 More broadly, the term refers to any database which exists in a single file in the form of rows and columns, with no relationships or links between records and fields except the table structure.
0.847: (the term; More broadly refers to; any database which exists in a single file in the form of rows and columns)
0.767: (any database; exists in; a single file)

The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing manytomany relationships in a treelike structure that allows multiple parents.

A set consists of circular linked lists where one record type, the set owner or parent, appears once in each circle, and a second record type, the subordinate or child, may appear multiple times in each circle.
0.908: (a second record type; may appear multiple times in; each circle)
0.874: (A set; may appear multiple times in; each circle)
0.809: (one record type; appears once in; each circle)
0.772: (a second record type; may appear; multiple times)
0.758: (A set; consists may of; circular linked lists where one record type , the set owner or parent , appears once in each circle)
0.703: (A set; may appear; multiple times)
0.686: (a second record type; consists may of; circular linked lists where one record type , the set owner or parent , appears once in each circle)

 In this way a hierarchy may be established between any two record types, e.
0.894: (a hierarchy; may be established between; any two record types)

 At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A.

0.619: (B; is; the owner of A.)

 Thus all the sets comprise a general directed graph , or network construct.

A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas.
0.927: (each database; is represented as; a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data ,)
0.825: (A flat database; is; a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table)
0.655: (each database; is represented in; a simple database system)

 The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file.
0.898: (The table; be physically represented as; a simple text file)

 Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships.
0.883: (they; are not unsuitable for; most software applications)
0.761: (they; are not unsuitable of; the limitations of flat databases)

 However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database.
0.739: (some application developers; However still use; flat files)

 Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flatfile databases.
0.892: (Flat databases; are also sometimes referred as; flatfile databases)

Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a nonrelational database.
No extractions found.

 A good example of a flat file is a single textonly file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter.
0.86: (all the data; be needed for; a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter)
0.698: (A good example of a flat file; is; a single textonly file that contains all the data)
0.564: (all the data needed for a program; be contains by; a single textonly file)
