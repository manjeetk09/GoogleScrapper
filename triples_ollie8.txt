For more complex functions using the definition of the derivative would be an almost impossible task.

  Luckily for us we won t have to use the definition terribly often.

  We will have to use it on occasion, however we have a large collection of formulas and properties that we can use to simplify our life considerably and will allow us to avoid using the definition whenever possible.
