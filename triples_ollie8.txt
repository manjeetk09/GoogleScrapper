Database design is a process of modeling an enterprise in the real world.
0.792: (Database design; is; a process modeling an enterprise in the real world)
0.674: (an enterprise; be modeling in; the real world)

 In fact, a database itself is a model of the real world that contains selected information needed by the enterprise.
0.909: (a database; is a model of; the real world)
0.782: (selected information; be needed by; the enterprise)
0.752: (a database; is; a model of the real world that contains selected information)
0.628: (selected information needed by the enterprise; be contains by; a model of the real world)
0.446: (a database; is a model of the real world in; fact)

 Many models and languages some formally and mathematically defined, some informal and intuitive are used by designers.

Database design is the process of producing a detailed data model of database.
0.792: (Database design; is; the process producing a detailed data model of database)

 This data model contains all the needed logical and physical design choices and physical storage parameters needed to generate a design in a data definition language, which can then be used to create a database.
0.681: (This data model; contains; all the needed logical and physical design choices and physical storage parameters)

 A fully attributed data model contains detailed attributes for each entity.

The term database design can be used to describe many different parts of the design of an overall database system.
0.769: (The term database design; to describe; many different parts of the design of an overall database system)
0.42: (different; be parts of; the design of an overall database system)
0.42: (many; be different parts of; the design of an overall database system)

 Principally, and most correctly, it can be thought of as the logical design of the base data structures used to store the data.
0.66: (the logical design of the base data structures; used to store; the data)
0.587: (the logical design of the base data structures; to store; the data)

 In the relational model these are the tables and views.

 In an object database the entities and relationships map directly to object classes and named relationships.

 However, the term database design could also be used to apply to the overall process of designing, not just the base data structures, but also the forms and queries used as part of the overall database application within the database management system .
0.823: (the base data structures , but also the forms and queries; be used as; part of the overall database application)
0.282: (the term database design; to apply to the overall process of designing , not to; the overall process designing)

A Database model defines the logical design of data.
0.833: (A Database model; defines; the logical design of data)

 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
0.807: (The model; describes; the relationships)
0.303: (different; be parts of; the data)

 Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
