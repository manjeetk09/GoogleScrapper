There are various types of algebraic functions.
The mathematical concept of a function expresses the intuitive idea that one quantity completely determines another quantity.
 An equation will be a function if for any x in the domain of the equation, there is exactly one value of y.
 More formally, a function is defined a type of relation which has only one output value with respect any permissible input value.
 The argument and the value may be real numbers, but they can also be elements from any given sets.
 the domain, the co_domain of the function and all the assigned values are in the Range of the function.
 It is important how we assign the values to each element of the domain.
 There may be different types of functions in mathematics.
 The classification of functions on the basis of properties may be as follows .
 Even Function Odd Function Monotonic Function Surjective Function Bijective Function Injective Function The functions can be classified into following on the basis of variables used .
 Algebraic Function Exponential Function Logarithmic Function Analytic Function Inverse Function Monotonic Function Polynomial Function Linear Function Quadratic Function Elliptic Function Identity Function Constant Function Power Function Vector_valued Function Integer_valued Function Periodic Function Piece_wise linear Function etc.
 In this article, we shall learn about few of the above mentioned types of functions.
A polynomial or algebraic function is a function which can be expressed in the following form.
  f  a_ n x  n    a_ n _ 1 x  n _ 1   .
   a_ 2 x  2    a_ 1 x  1    a_ 0  .
The graphs that these types of functions produce vary depending on the power.
 If the power is positive, the graph changes direction based on the number of the power.
 If the power is even, the graph will have both edges going in the same direction.
 If the power is odd, the graph will have one edge going up and another going down.
 If the power is negative, it will have two parts.
 Each part will avoid the x 0 line because that will cause division by zero.
 When the power is a fraction, the graph goes up at x 0 and then when y is positive, it starts curving towards the x_axis.
 Even and Odd functions and.
 Algebraic and Transcendental functions.
