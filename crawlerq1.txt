In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation
 Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power
Examples of such functions are
 f   1   x   displaystyle f 1 x 
 f   x   displaystyle f   sqrt  x   
 f   1   x 3 x 3   7   7 x 1   3   displaystyle f   frac   sqrt  1 x  3    x  3 7 _  sqrt  7  x  1 3    
 This is the case, for example, of the Bring radical, which is the function implicitly defined by
where the coefficients aiare polynomial functions of x, with coefficients belonging to a set S
where the coefficients aiare polynomial functions of x, with coefficients belonging to a set S
A function which is not algebraic is called a transcendental function, as it is for example the case of exp   , tan   , ln   ,     displaystyle  exp, tan, ln, Gamma   
A function which is not algebraic is called a transcendental function, as it is for example the case of exp   , tan   , ln   ,     displaystyle  exp, tan, ln, Gamma   
 A composition of transcendental functions can give an algebraic function
 f   cos       1   x 2   displaystyle f  cos    sqrt  1_x  2     
As an equation of degree n has n roots, a polynomial equation does not implicitly define a single function, but n functions, sometimes also called branches
 Consider for example the equation of the unit circle
 y 2   x 2   1
   displaystyle y  2  x  2  1
 ,  This determines y, except only up to an overall sign  accordingly, it has two branches
 y     1   x 2 
   displaystyle y  pm   sqrt  1_x  2   
 , 
An algebraic function in m variables is similarly defined as a function y which solves a polynomial equation in m   1 variables

The informal definition of an algebraic function provides a number of clues about their properties

 To gain an intuitive understanding, it may be helpful to regard algebraic functions as functions which can be formed by the usual algebraic operations
 To gain an intuitive understanding, it may be helpful to regard algebraic functions as functions which can be formed by the usual algebraic operations
 addition, multiplication, division, and taking an nth root
 This is something of an oversimplification  because of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, algebraic functions need not be expressible by radicals
First, note that any polynomial function y   p   displaystyle y p  is an algebraic function, since it is simply the solution y to the equation
More generally, any rational function y   p q   displaystyle y   frac  p  q    is algebraic, being the solution to
Moreover, the nth root of any polynomial y   p n   displaystyle y   sqrt p    is an algebraic function, solving the equation
 For supposing that y is a solution to
 Indeed, interchanging the roles of x and y and gathering terms,
Writing x as a function of y gives the inverse function, also an algebraic function
 For example, y   x2 fails the horizontal line test
 it fails to be one_to_one
 The inverse is the algebraic  function  x     y   displaystyle x  pm   sqrt  y    
 Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve
 Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve
 Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve
 Hence any polynomial relation p  0 is guaranteed to have at least one solution for y at each point x, provided we allow y to assume complex as well as real values
 Thus, problems to do with the domain of an algebraic function can safely be minimized
Furthermore, even if one is ultimately interested in real algebraic functions, there may be no means to express the function in terms of addition, multiplication, division and taking nth roots without resorting to complex numbers 
Furthermore, even if one is ultimately interested in real algebraic functions, there may be no means to express the function in terms of addition, multiplication, division and taking nth roots without resorting to complex numbers 
 For example, consider the algebraic function determined by the equation
Using the cubic formula, we get
For x   3 4 3 ,   displaystyle x leq   frac  3   sqrt 4   ,  the square root is real and the cubic root is thus well defined, providing the unique real root
 On the other hand, for x   3 4 3 ,   displaystyle x   frac  3   sqrt 4   ,  the square root is not real, and one has to choose, for the square root, either non_real square root
 On the other hand, for x   3 4 3 ,   displaystyle x   frac  3   sqrt 4   ,  the square root is not real, and one has to choose, for the square root, either non_real square root
 Thus the cubic root has to be chosen among three non_real numbers
 If the same choices are done in the two terms of the formula, the three choices for the cubic root provide the three branches shown, in the accompanying image

On a more significant theoretical level, using complex numbers allows one to use the powerful techniques of complex analysis to discuss algebraic functions
 In particular, the argument principle can be used to show that any algebraic function is in fact an analytic function, at least in the multiple_valued sense

Formally, let pbe a complex polynomial in the complex variables x and y
 Suppose that x0   C is such that the polynomial pof y has n distinct zeros
 Suppose that x0   C is such that the polynomial pof y has n distinct zeros
 Suppose that x0   C is such that the polynomial pof y has n distinct zeros
 We shall show that the algebraic function is analytic in a neighborhood of x0
 Choose a system of n non_overlapping discs  i containing each of these zeros
 Then by the argument principle
By continuity, this also holds for all x in a neighborhood of x0
 In particular, phas only one root in  i, given by the residue theorem
which is an analytic function
Note that the foregoing proof of analyticity derived an expression for a system of n different function elements fi, provided that x is not a critical point of p
Note that the foregoing proof of analyticity derived an expression for a system of n different function elements fi, provided that x is not a critical point of p
 A critical point is a point where the number of distinct zeros is smaller than the degree of p, and this occurs only where the highest degree term of p vanishes, and where the discriminant vanishes
 A critical point is a point where the number of distinct zeros is smaller than the degree of p, and this occurs only where the highest degree term of p vanishes, and where the discriminant vanishes
 Hence there are only finitely many such points c1, 
, cm
Note that, away from the critical points, we have
since the fi are by definition the distinct zeros of p
since the fi are by definition the distinct zeros of p
  The monodromy action on the universal covering space is related but different notion in the theory of Riemann surfaces
 
The ideas surrounding algebraic functions go back at least as far as Ren  Descartes

 There is a large theory of special functions which developed out of statistics and mathematical physics
 A modern, abstract point of view contrasts large function spaces, which are infinite_dimensional and within which most functions are  anonymous , with special functions picked out by properties such as symmetry, or relationship to harmonic analysis and group representations

An algebraic function is a function that involves only algebraic operations, like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as fractional or rational exponents
 Think of an algebraic function as a machine, where real numbers go in, mathematical operations occur, and other numbers come out
We call the numbers going into an algebraic function the input, x, or the domain
We call the numbers going into an algebraic function the input, x, or the domain
 We call the numbers coming out of a function the output, y, or the range
 Remember, one value in, one value out
There are many different types of algebraic functions
 linear, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, rational, and radical equations
 In this next part of the lesson, we ll learn about a couple of different methods we can use to identify them
 Sometimes functions multiply the domain to get the range, like 3x
 Functions may also subtract or divide the domain or use a combination of operations to produce the range
 As long as the rule of  one in one out  is kept in place, the function exists
If an algebraic function says to add two to the domain, we can create a table to show the function
As you can see, for every domain, we have one range
 These pairs of x values_ and y_values are called ordered pairs because we put them in order 
 These pairs of x values_ and y_values are called ordered pairs because we put them in order 
We can also turn our table into ordered pairs to show a function
 , , and where there is one x_value for every one y_value
We can also use graphs to identify functions by plotting ordered pairs onto a Cartesian Coordinate System, where the x_values are on the horizontal line and the y_values are on the vertical line
We can also use graphs to identify functions by plotting ordered pairs onto a Cartesian Coordinate System, where the x_values are on the horizontal line and the y_values are on the vertical line

We can also use graphs to identify functions by plotting ordered pairs onto a Cartesian Coordinate System, where the x_values are on the horizontal line and the y_values are on the vertical line
 Where the ordered pairs meet is where the point is graphed
 If we plot the points, we end up with a straight line, so the function, x   2, is considered a linear function and can be written in functional notation as f  x   2
 If we plot the points, we end up with a straight line, so the function, x   2, is considered a linear function and can be written in functional notation as f  x   2
 If we plot the points, we end up with a straight line, so the function, x   2, is considered a linear function and can be written in functional notation as f  x   2
 The fis just another way to write y, which we call the f_function
 It is a way for us to identify the different functions, instead of calling them all y   
We know a graph is a function if it can pass the vertical line test
We know a graph is a function if it can pass the vertical line test
 If a vertical line crosses in two places on a graph, it is in conflict with the one in, one out rule
 So, it is not a function
Here is an example of a graph that is not a function

 Let s start with a quadratic function
The quadratic function
 g  x 2 _ 3
 First, let s create a table
The domain can be any real number, this is why the x_value or domain is called the independent variable
The range or y_value is called the dependent variable because it depends on what we use for the x_term

Writing the numbers in our table as ordered pairs, we have
 , , , , 
 Did you notice how we repeated some of the range values  Is this acceptable  YES, because each ordered pair has one x_value and one y_value
 Did you notice how we repeated some of the range values  Is this acceptable  YES, because each ordered pair has one x_value and one y_value
 The y_values can be repeated as long as the x_values are not repeated
Now let s graph this function and use the vertical line test to make sure we still have an algebraic function
Now let s graph this function and use the vertical line test to make sure we still have an algebraic function
Now let s graph this function and use the vertical line test to make sure we still have an algebraic function
We call this function a quadratic function because it has a squared term, x 2
Now let s take a look at a cubic function
 h  x 3   x _ 2 and use the following values for the domain
 _2, _1, 0, 1, and 2
Writing these values as ordered pairs we have
 , , , , 
On a graph our ordered pairs will look like this
After applying the vertical line test, we can see this is truly a function 
An algebraic function is an equation that allows one to input a domain, or x_value and perform mathematical calculations to get an output, which is the range, or y_value, that is specific for that particular x_value
