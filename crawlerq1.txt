An object_relational database combines the two related structures
A given database management system may provide one or more models
 The optimal structure depends on the natural organization of the application s data, and on the application s requirements, which include transaction rate , reliability, maintainability, scalability, and cost
 Most database management systems are built around one particular data model, although it is possible for products to offer support for more than one model
Various physical data models can implement any given logical model
 Most database software will offer the user some level of control in tuning the physical implementation, since the choices that are made have a significant effect on performance
A model is not just a way of structuring data
 Although these operations may not be explicit in a particular query language, they provide the foundation on which a query language is built

The flat model consists of a single, two_dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another
The flat model consists of a single, two_dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another
 Each row would have the specific password associated with an individual user
 This tabular format is a precursor to the relational model
These models were popular in the 1960s, 1970s, but nowadays can be found primarily in old legacy systems
In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree_like structure, implying a single parent for each record

 A sort field keeps sibling records in a particular order
 Hierarchical structures were widely used in the early mainframe database management systems, such as the Information Management System by IBM, and now describe the structure of XML documents
 This structure allows one one_to_many relationship between two types of data
 This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world  recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs verses, any nested and sorted information
 This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world  recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs verses, any nested and sorted information
This hierarchy is used as the physical order of records in storage
 Such limitations have been compensated for in later IMS versions by additional logical hierarchies imposed on the base physical hierarchy
The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing many_to_many relationships in a tree_like structure that allows multiple parents
 It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification

 Records contain fields 
 Sets define one_to_many relationships between records
 A record may be an owner in any number of sets, and a member in any number of sets
 At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A
 Access to records is either sequential or by navigation in the circular linked lists
The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
 a program maintains a current position, and navigates from one record to another by following the relationships in which the record participates
Although it is not an essential feature of the model, network databases generally implement the set relationships by means of pointers that directly address the location of a record on disk
Popular DBMS products that utilized it were Cincom Systems  Total and Cullinet s IDMS
 IDMS gained a considerable customer base  in the 1980s, it adopted the relational model and SQL in addition to its original tools and languages

Most object databases use the navigational concept to provide fast navigation across networks of objects, generally using object identifiers as  smart  pointers to related objects
In an inverted file or inverted index, the contents of the data are used as keys in a lookup table, and the values in the table are pointers to the location of each instance of a given content item

 A relation is a table with columns and rows
The basic data structure of the relational model is the table, where information about a particular entity is represented in rows and columns

 The columns enumerate the various attributes of the entity , and a row is an actual instance of the entity that is represented by the relation
 As a result, each tuple of the employee table represents various attributes of a single employee
 First, the ordering of columns is immaterial in a table
A relational database contains multiple tables, each similar to the one in the  flat  database model
 One of the strengths of the relational model is that, in principle, any value occurring in two different records , implies a relationship among those two records
 Tables can also have a designated single attribute or a set of attributes that can act as a  key , which can be used to uniquely identify each tuple in the table
 For example, an Employee table may contain a column named Location which contains a value that matches the key of a Location table
 Any column can be a key, or multiple columns can be grouped together into a compound key
 It is not necessary to define all the keys in advance  a column can be used as a key even if it was not originally intended to be one

 If no natural key is suitable , an arbitrary or surrogate key can be assigned 
 In practice, most databases have both generated and natural keys, because generated keys can be used internally to create links between rows that cannot break, while natural keys can be used, less reliably, for searches and for integration with other databases

The dimensional model is a specialized adaptation of the relational model used to represent data in data warehouses in a way that data can be easily summarized using online analytical processing, or OLAP queries
 In the dimensional model, a database schema consists of a single large table of facts that are described using dimensions and measures
 A dimension provides the context of a fact and is used in queries to group related facts together
 A dimension provides the context of a fact and is used in queries to group related facts together
 A measure is a quantity describing the fact, such as revenue
 It is important that measures can be meaningfully aggregated for example, the revenue from different locations can be added together
In an OLAP query, dimensions are chosen and the facts are grouped and aggregated together to create a summary
In an OLAP query, dimensions are chosen and the facts are grouped and aggregated together to create a summary
 An alternative physical implementation, called a snowflake schema, normalizes multi_level hierarchies within a dimension into multiple tables
A data warehouse can contain multiple dimensional schemas that share dimension tables, allowing them to be used together
 Coming up with a standard set of dimensions is an important part of dimensional modeling

 Codd s Information Principle, which requires that
 For example, they allow representation of a directed graph with trees on the nodes
 The German company sones implements this concept in its GraphDB
Some post_relational products extend relational systems with non_relational features
 Others arrived in much the same place by adding relational features to pre_relational systems
 Others arrived in much the same place by adding relational features to pre_relational systems
 Paradoxically, this allows products that are historically pre_relational, such as PICK and MUMPS, to make a plausible claim to be post_relational
The resource space model is a non_relational data model based on multi_dimensional classification
The resource space model is a non_relational data model based on multi_dimensional classification
Graph databases allow even more general structure than a network database  any node may be connected to any other node
Multivalue databases are  lumpy  data, in that they can store exactly the same way as relational databases, but they also permit a level of depth which the relational model can only approximate using sub_tables
 This is nearly identical to the way XML expresses data, where a given field attribute can have multiple right answers at the same time
 Multivalue can be thought of as a compressed form of XML
An example is an invoice, which in either multivalue or relational data could be seen as Invoice Header Table _ one entry per invoice, and Invoice Detail Table _ one entry per line item
 In the multivalue model, we have the option of storing the data as on table, with an embedded table to represent the detail
 This aims to avoid the object_relational impedance mismatch _ the overhead of converting information between its representation in the database and its representation in the application program 
 Even further, the type system used in a particular application can be defined directly in the database, allowing the database to enforce the same data integrity invariants
A variety of these ways have been triedfor storing objects in a database
 This typically requires the addition of some kind of query language, since conventional programming languages do not have the ability to find objects based on their information content
 This typically requires the addition of some kind of query language, since conventional programming languages do not have the ability to find objects based on their information content
 Others have attacked the problem from the database end, by defining an object_oriented data model for the database, and defining a database programming language that allows full programming capabilities as well as traditional query facilities
An alternative to translating between objects and relational databases is to use an object_relational mapping library

A database model shows the logical structure of a database, including the relationships and constraints that determine how data can be stored and accessed
 Most data models can be represented by an accompanying database diagram
You may choose to describe a database with any one of these depending on several factors
 The biggest factor is whether the database management system you are using supports a particular model
 Most database management systems are built with a particular data model in mind and require their users to adopt that model, although some do support multiple models
In addition, different models apply to different stages of the database design process
 Record_based logical models, on the other hand, more closely reflect ways that the data is stored on the server
Selecting a data model is also a matter of aligning your priorities for the database with the strengths of a particular model, whether those priorities include speed, cost reduction, usability, or something else

Let s take a closer look at some of the most common database models
The most common model, the relational model sorts data into tables, also known as relations, each of which consists of columns and rows
 Each column lists an attribute of the entity in question, such as price, zip code, or birth date
The model also accounts for the types of relationships between those tables, including one_to_one, one_to_many, and many_to_many relationships
Within the database, tables can be normalized, or brought to comply with normalization rules that make the database flexible, adaptable, and scalable
 When normalized, each piece of data is atomic, or broken into the smallest useful pieces
 The model was introduced by E
The hierarchical model organizes data into a tree_like structure, where each record has a single parent or root

 Sibling records are sorted in a particular order
 That order is used as the physical order for storing the database
 This model is good for describing many real_world relationships
The network model builds on the hierarchical model by allowing many_to_many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent records
The network model builds on the hierarchical model by allowing many_to_many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent records
 Each set consists of one owner or parent record and one or more member or child records
 A record can be a member or child in multiple sets, allowing this model to convey complex relationships

It was most popular in the 70s after it was formally defined by the Conference on Data Systems Languages 
This model defines a database as a collection of objects, or reusable software elements, with associated features and methods
A hypertext database allows any object to link to any other object
 It s useful for organizing lots of disparate data, but it s not ideal for numerical analysis
The object_oriented database model is the best known post_relational database model, since it incorporates tables, but isn t limited to tables
This hybrid database model combines the simplicity of the relational model with some of the advanced functionality of the object_oriented database model
 In essence, it allows designers to incorporate objects into the familiar table structure
Languages and call interfaces include SQL3, vendor languages, ODBC, JDBC, and proprietary call interfaces that are extensions of the languages and interfaces used by the relational model

This model captures the relationships between real_world entities much like the network model, but it isn t as directly tied to the physical structure of the database
Here, the people, places, and things about which data points are stored are referred to as entities, each of which has certain attributes that together make up their domain

Each cell in a dimensional database contains data about the dimensions tracked by the database
 Here the distinction between data and schema is vague at best
 This model is useful for describing systems, such as certain Web_based data sources, which we treat as databases but cannot constrain with a schema
This model divides all the data points based on whether they describe an entity or an association
This model divides all the data points based on whether they describe an entity or an association
 In this model, an entity is anything that exists independently, whereas an association is something that only exists in relation to something else
 The stored fact has to do with the source, and each of the three identifiers may refer either to a link or an item

Most websites rely on some kind of database to organize and present data to users
 Whenever someone uses the search functions on these sites, their search terms are converted into queries for a database server to process

In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
 Also we assume that no more than one shipment exists for a given supplier part combination in the shipments table
The tree structure has parts record superior to supplier record
 Each supplier occurrence includes the corresponding shipment quantity
 It is not possible to insert the information of the supplier e
 So, we can say that insert anomaly exists only for those children, which has no corresponding parents
 So, we can say that insert anomaly exists only for those children, which has no corresponding parents
 So, we can say that update anomalies only exist for children not for parent because children may have multiple entries in the database
 In hierarchical model, deletion of parent causes the deletion of child records also and if the child occurrence is the only occurrence in the whole database, then the information of child records will also lost with the deletion of parent
 Find the supplier number for suppliers who supply part P2
 In order to get this information, first we search the information of parent P2 from database, since parent occurs only once in the whole database, so we obtain only a single record for P2
 If supplier S2, is found under a part then the corresponding part number is printed, otherwise we go to next part until all the parts are searched for supplier S2
Since, both the queries involved different logic and are complex, so we can conclude that retrieval operation of this model is complex and asymmetric
 As explained earlier, we can conclude that hierarchical model suffers from the Insertion anomalies, Update anomalies and Deletion anomalies, also the retrieval operation is complex and asymmetric, and thus hierarchical model is not suitable for all the cases

 The actual implementation of a hierarchical database depends on the physical storage of data
 The actual implementation of a hierarchical database depends on the physical storage of data
 Programming a hierarchical database is relatively complex because the programmers must know the physical path of the data items
 If you make any changes in the database structure of a hierarchical database, then you need to make the necessary changes in all the application programs that access the database
 Hierarchical database systems use physical storage paths to navigate to the different data segments
 So, the application programs should have a good knowledge of the relevant access paths to access the data

The Relational Model was the first theoretically founded and well thought out Data Model, proposed by EfCodd in 1970, then a researcher at IBM
The Relational Model is a depiction of how each piece of stored information relates to the other stored information
 It shows how tables are linked, what type of links are between tables, what keys are used, what information is referenced between tables
 It s an essential part of developing a normalized database structure to prevent repeat and redundant data storage
The basic idea behind the relational model is that a database consists of a series of unordered tables that can be manipulated using non_procedural operations that return tables
 This model was in vast contrast to the more traditional database theories of the time that were much more complicated, less flexible and dependent on the physical storage methods of the data

It is commonly thought that the word relational in the relational model comes from the fact that you relate together tables in a relational database
 Instead, the word relational has its roots in the terminology that Codd used to define the relational model
 Instead, the word relational has its roots in the terminology that Codd used to define the relational model
 The table in Codd s writings was actually referred to as a relation 
In fact, Codd use the terms relations, attributes and tuples where most of us use the more common terms tables, columns and rows, respectively 
 Still, it has a long way to go before it meets all twelve rules completely
An object_oriented database management system is a DBMS that stores data in a logical model that is closely aligned with an application program s object model
An object_oriented database management system is a DBMS that stores data in a logical model that is closely aligned with an application program s object model
 Of course, an OODBMS will have a physical data model optimized for the kinds of logical data model it expects
Object oriented database models have been around since the seventies when the concept of object oriented programming was first explored
 It is only in the last ten or fifteen years that companies are utilizing object oriented DBMSs 
The result can be a performance increase of ten to one thousand times while writing as little as 40  of the code
