0;Hierarchical Databases In the Hierarchical Database Model we have to learn about the databases.
0; It is very fast and simple.
0; In a hierarchical database, records contain information about there groups of parent child relationships, just like as a tree structure.
0; The structure implies that a record can have also a repeating information.
0; In this structure Data follows a series of records, It is a set of field values attached to it.
0; It collects all records together as a record type.
0; These record types are the equivalent of tables in the relational model, and with the individual records being the equivalent of rows.
0; To create links between these record types, the hierarchical model uses these type Relationships.

0;Advantage Hierarchical database can be accessed and updated rapidly because in this model structure is like as a tree and the relationships between records are defined in advance.
0; This feature is a two_edged.

0;Disadvantage This type of database structure is that each child in the tree may have only one parent, and relationships or linkages between children are not permitted, even if they make sense from a logical standpoint.
0; Hierarchical databases are so in their design.
0; it can adding a new field or record requires that the entire database be redefined.
0; Network Database A network databases are mainly used on a large digital computers.
0; It more connections can be made between different types of data, network databases are considered more efficiency It contains limitations must be considered when we have to use this kind of database.
0; It is Similar to the hierarchical databases, network databases .
0;Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases by also having a hierarchical structure.
0; A network database looks more like a cobweb or interconnected network of records.
