0;An algebraic function is a function that involves only algebraic operations, like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as fractional or rational exponents.
0; Think of an algebraic function as a machine, where real numbers go in, mathematical operations occur, and other numbers come out.

0;An algebraic function is a function which satisfies , where is a polynomial in and with integer coefficients.
0; Functions that can be constructed using only a finite number of elementary operations together with the inverses of functions capable of being so constructed are examples of algebraic functions.
0; Nonalgebraic functions are called transcendental functions.
0;This function is a well_defined function, since we assume every element  x  in X  is mapped via the function machine to a unique element  y  in X , i.
0;e.
0;, every person  x  has exactly one mother  y .
0; Although the codomain is the set of all people  X , it s clear that it will be impossible for this function to output certain people.
0; There s no way the mother function  m  could output any males, nor could it output any childless females.
0; In other words, the range of the function  m  is the set of female people who have had children, which is a proper subset of the set  X  of all people.
0;We can also define a function using an algebraic formula, such as  f x 2 1 .
0; Such algebraic formulas are the way many people think of functions, though, as the above examples show, such a formula is not required.

0;                   .
0;Okay, with that out of the way let s get back to the definition of a function and let s look at some examples of equations that are functions and equations that aren t functions.
