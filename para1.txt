The Propagating Cipher Block Chaining or plaintext cipher-block chaining mode was designed to cause small changes in the ciphertext to propagate indefinitely when decrypting, as well as when encrypting. In PCBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with both the previous plaintext block and the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. As with CBC mode, an initialization vector is used in the first block.

Encryption and decryption algorithms are as follows:












Cipher block chaining (CBC) is a mode of operation for a block cipher (one in which a sequence of bits are encrypted as a single unit or block with a cipher key applied to the entire block). Cipher block chaining uses what is known as an initialization vector (IV) of a certain length. One of its key characteristics is that it uses a chaining mechanism that causes the decryption of a block of ciphertext to depend on all the preceding ciphertext blocks. As a result, the entire validity of all preceding blocks is contained in the immediately previous ciphertext block. A single bit error in a ciphertext block affects the decryption of all subsequent blocks. Rearrangement of the order of the ciphertext blocks causes decryption to become corrupted. Basically, in cipher block chaining, each plaintext block is XORed (see XOR) with the immediately previous ciphertext block, and then encrypted.

In CBC mode, the current plaintext block is added to the previous ciphertext block, and then the result is encrypted with the key. Decryption is thus the reverse process, which involves decrypting the current ciphertext and then adding the previous ciphertext block to the result.

Apparently, CFB mode is converting a block cipher into a type of stream cipher. The encryption algorithm is used as a key-stream generator to produce key-stream that is placed in the bottom register. This key stream is then XORed with the plaintext as in case of stream cipher.

A stream-cipher is usually built by combining a block-cipher and some sort of feedback via some simple operations. The most simple stream-cipher is the electronic codebook (ECB) mode: No chaining is used. The plaintext is partitioned into n blocks P1,..., Pn of size b . (If the last block Pn is shorter than b it is padded appropriately.) The ciphertext blocks C1,..., Cn are obtained by applying the block-cipher to each block of the plaintext. More formally, Ci = EK(Pi) . Decryption is simple, too: Pi = DK(Ci) . This simplicity has an important drawback: If a block B appears several times in the plaintext each occurence encrypts to the same ciphertext block. This can be exploited by an attacker: Suppose that the attacker knows P1 (maybe because every plaintext starts with a fixed header) then he is able to detect every occurence of P1 in the plaintext without knowing the key!

More formally, Ci = EK(Pi) . Decryption is simple, too: Pi = DK(Ci) . This simplicity has an important drawback: If a block B appears several times in the plaintext each occurence encrypts to the same ciphertext block. This can be exploited by an attacker: Suppose that the attacker knows P1 (maybe because every plaintext starts with a fixed header) then he is able to detect every occurence of P1 in the plaintext without knowing the key!
