Many Eclipse perspectives, e.g. the Java Development Tools (JDT), provide a debugger front-end. Allinea DDT - a graphical debugger supporting for parallel/multi-process and multithreaded applications, for C++/C++ and F90. DDD is the standard front-end from the GNU Project. It is a complex tool that works with most common debuggers (GDB, jdb, Python debugger, Perl debugger, Tcl, and others) natively or with some external programs (for PHP). GDB (the GNU debugger) GUI Emacs — Emacs editor with built-in support for the GNU Debugger acts as the frontend. KDbg — Part of the KDE development tools. Nemiver — A GDB frontend that integrates well in the GNOME desktop environment. xxgdb — X-window frontend for GDB and dbx debugger. Qt Creator — multi-platform frontend for GDB, CDB and LLDB. Allinea's DDT — a parallel and distributed front-end to a modified version of GDB. Xcode — contains a GDB front-end as well. SlickEdit — contains a GDB front-end as well. Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools (CDT) — includes visual debugging tools based on GDB. CodeLite — An open source, cross platform C/C++ IDE which have front end for gdb, the next version of CodeLite (v6.0) will also include a front end to the LLDB (debugger) CodeBlocks — A free cross-platform C, C++ and Fortran IDE with a front end for gdb. RR — An open source C/C++ debugger by Mozilla, supporting reproduction of program state and reverse execution

The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running Linux kernel on the source level with gdb. With KGDB, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs. It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code and observe variables. On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed. KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a serial cable or Ethernet. On FreeBSD, it is also possible to debug using Firewire direct memory access (DMA).

To provide an insight into the quality of software that is available, we have compiled a list of 9 advanced Linux debugging tools. Hopefully, there will be something of interest here for anyone who wants to fix, and help fix, bugs.
