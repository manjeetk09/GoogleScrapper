As we point out and use functions in real-life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input-output situations in the real world. You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. (The function rule is the product price. The input is the money combined with the selected button. The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.). Measurement: Â Thermometer Most thermometers come with both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. Students can study a thermometer as an input/output table. Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales (noting, for instance, that 0Â° C = 32Â° F and 32Â° C = 50Â° F) and figure out the mystery function rule -- the formula for converting from one scale to the other. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

As we point out and use functions in real-life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input-output situations in the real world. You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. (The function rule is the product price. The input is the money combined with the selected button. The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.). Measurement: Â Thermometer Most thermometers come with both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. Students can study a thermometer as an input/output table. Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales (noting, for instance, that 0Â° C = 32Â° F and 32Â° C = 50Â° F) and figure out the mystery function rule -- the formula for converting from one scale to the other. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

As we point out and use functions in real-life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input-output situations in the real world. You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. (The function rule is the product price. The input is the money combined with the selected button. The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.). Measurement: Â Thermometer Most thermometers come with both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. Students can study a thermometer as an input/output table. Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales (noting, for instance, that 0Â° C = 32Â° F and 32Â° C = 50Â° F) and figure out the mystery function rule -- the formula for converting from one scale to the other. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

As we point out and use functions in real-life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input-output situations in the real world. You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. (The function rule is the product price. The input is the money combined with the selected button. The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.). Measurement: Â Thermometer Most thermometers come with both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. Students can study a thermometer as an input/output table. Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales (noting, for instance, that 0Â° C = 32Â° F and 32Â° C = 50Â° F) and figure out the mystery function rule -- the formula for converting from one scale to the other. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. (The function rule is the product price. The input is the money combined with the selected button. The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.). Measurement: Â Thermometer Most thermometers come with both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. Students can study a thermometer as an input/output table. Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales (noting, for instance, that 0Â° C = 32Â° F and 32Â° C = 50Â° F) and figure out the mystery function rule -- the formula for converting from one scale to the other. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.). Measurement: Â Thermometer Most thermometers come with both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. Students can study a thermometer as an input/output table. Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales (noting, for instance, that 0Â° C = 32Â° F and 32Â° C = 50Â° F) and figure out the mystery function rule -- the formula for converting from one scale to the other. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales (noting, for instance, that 0Â° C = 32Â° F and 32Â° C = 50Â° F) and figure out the mystery function rule -- the formula for converting from one scale to the other. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

As we point out and use functions in real-life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input-output situations in the real world. You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot.

Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size. Most of the examples in this article have featured data tables for analyzing functions, but of course, graphs are another effective means of representing input-output situations, including changes over time (whether the rate of change is constant or varying). As students begin to use functions in the real world, more and more opportunities will present themselves, and the concept and value of functions will truly come to life.

As we point out and use functions in real-life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input-output situations in the real world. You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. (The function rule is the product price. The input is the money combined with the selected button. The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.).

Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table. If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what's the function rule? As they divide each container's circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio -- a rough approximation of pi. Arm length is a function of height.. Miles per gallon A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.. Basic economics and money math: A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand: As price goes up, demand goes down.. Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings; the same function rule (ratio) by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input (the height of the large object) when we measure its shadow.. Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler's rule? F + V = E + 2 (The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.) For example: Â  # sides per face faces edges vertices tetrahedron 3 4 6 4 hexahedron 3 6 9 5 octahedron 3 8 12 6 decahedron 3 10 15 7 icosahedron 3 20 30 12 cube 4 6 12 8 dodecahedron 5 12 30 20 Pattern block trains # of "cat heads" perimeter 1 7 2 12 3 17 Students can arrange a few pattern blocks in a simple design, give it a name, find the perimeter of the design (counting a standard edge as one unit), and then make a train of 2 or 3 repetitions of that design and find the perimeter of the train as it grows. As they make a data table, can they find a function rule or rules describing the relationship between the number of repetitions and the perimeter of the train? The function rule: x5 +2 (or 5n + 2). Geometric patterns in the world around us You or your students could take photos of architectural details with repeating patterns and make a table to analyze each pattern. For example, in the brick wall shown here, if each brick is 2" x 8", what is the perimeter of a series of bricks arranged in a stair-step pattern? What function rule describes that relationship? # of bricks perimeter 1 20 2 32 3 44 The function rule is x6 + 4 (or 6n + 4). How about the patterns found in floor or wall tiles? What is the ratio of one color to another color? How many tiles of each color would we need to purchase to tile a room of a given size? What if we wanted to include a border of a given color? Some of the mosaic floor designs in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. are magnificent (and challenging) examples to study. Click here to view the images below in full-size.

As we point out and use functions in real-life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input-output situations in the real world. You might draw from the following examples: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot.

We use algebra quite frequently in our everyday lives, and without even realizing it! We not only use algebra, we actually need algebra, to solve most of our problems that involves calculations.
Here are some simple examples that demonstrate the relevance of algebra in the real world.
The figure below illustrates the problem: The different shapes inside the bags denote different items purchased. The number depicts the item number.
The figure below illustrates the problem: The different shapes inside the bags denote different items purchased. The number depicts the item number.
The figure below illustrates the problem: The different shapes inside the bags denote different items purchased. The number depicts the item number.
We use simple algebraic formula `x/y` to calculate the number of bags.
x = Number of items purchased = 10
y = Capacity of 1 bag = 3
Hence,
`10/3` = `3.33` bags ≈ `4` bags
`10/3` = `3.33` bags ≈ `4` bags
So,we need 4 shopping bags to put 10 items.
The figure below shows the three items in different shapes and colors.
This will help your mind to calculate faster.
We will use algebra to solve the problem easily and quickly.
The prices are
a = Price of two dozen eggs = $10
b = Price of one bread = $5
c = Price of one bottle of juice= $8
=> Money needed = a + 3b + 5c
=> Money needed = $10 + 3($5) + 5($8) = $10 + $15 + $40 = $65
In the below diagram, each block represents $1, and each row is a bundle of $3, which is used to buy 1 gallon of gas.
We use simple algebraic formula,`x/y` to calculate the total gallons that can be bought.
x = Money in your pocket= $15
y = Price of 1 gallon of gas= $3
Hence,
`($15)/($3)` = 5 gallon
So, with $15 we can buy 5 gallons of gas.
Life's many problems are disguised in the form of math equations, and if we know the math, it's fairly simple to solve those problems.

Let "`x`" represent the first number
So, `x` = first number
`x+1` = second number
`x+2`= third number
3.  Write the equation
3.  Write the equation
When you add up all the numbers, you are supposed to get 216
`x + (x + 1) + (x + 2 )`= 216
`3x + 3 `= 216
4.  Solve the equation
4.  Solve the equation
Subtract 3 from both sides
`3x + 3 - 3 `= 216 - 3
`3x ` = 213
Divide each side by 3
`(3x) / 3 `= 213 ÷ 3
`x = 71`
5.  Check your answer
5.  Check your answer
First number + Second number + Third number = 216
`x + (x + 1 )+ (x + 2)`
71 + (71 + 1) + (71 + 2)
71 + 72 + 73 = 216
So the three numbers whose sum is 216 are 71, 72 and 73

Let’s say, `x` = cost of ticket/person and `y` = cost of popcorn/person
3.  Write the equation
3.  Write the equation
If 5 tickets cost $55, then cost of one ticket is,
`5x` = 55
`x ` = `55 / 5`
If 5 bags of popcorn cost $25, then the cost of each bag is,
`5y ` = 25
`y ` = `25 / 5`
Total cost of the movie (ticket + popcorn) per person = `x + y `
4.  Solve the equation
4.  Solve the equation
Cost of ticket/person
`x` = `55 / 5`
`x` = $11
Cost of popcorn/person
`y ` = `25 / 5`
`y ` = $5
5.  Check your answer
5.  Check your answer
Cost of ticket/person + Cost of popcorn/person = Total cost
11 + 5 = 16
If we add up 16 five times (since there are 5 boys), the result is,
16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 80
$80 is the total cost.
