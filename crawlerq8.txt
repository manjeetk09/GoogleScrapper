Database design is a process of modeling an enterprise in the real world.
 In fact, a database itself is a model of the real world that contains selected information needed by the enterprise.
 Many models and languages some formally and mathematically defined, some informal and intuitive are used by designers.
 Here are the ones that we present in this tutorial.
There are many kinds of data models.
 Some of the most common ones include.
 Hierarchical database model.
 Relational model.
 Network model.
 Object_oriented database model.
 Entity_relationship model.
 Document model.
 Entity_attribute_value model.
 Star schema.
 The object_relational model, which combines the two that make up its name.

Database design is the process of producing a detailed data model of database.
 This data model contains all the needed logical and physical design choices and physical storage parameters needed to generate a design in a data definition language, which can then be used to create a database.
 A fully attributed data model contains detailed attributes for each entity.

The term database design can be used to describe many different parts of the design of an overall database system.
 Principally, and most correctly, it can be thought of as the logical design of the base data structures used to store the data.
 In the relational model these are the tables and views.
 In an object database the entities and relationships map directly to object classes and named relationships.
 However, the term database design could also be used to apply to the overall process of designing, not just the base data structures, but also the forms and queries used as part of the overall database application within the database management system .

A Database model defines the logical design of data.
 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
 Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
 They are, Hierarchical Model.
 Network Model.
 Relational Model.
