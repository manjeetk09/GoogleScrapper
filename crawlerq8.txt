An algebraic function is a function that can be written using a finite number of the basic operations of arithmetic  i.
e.
, addition, multiplication, and exponentiation .
 In order to take the derivative of these functions, we will need the power rule.
Find the derivatives of various functions using different methods and rules.
 Several Examples with detailed solutions are presented.
 More exercises with answers are at the end of this page.
Example.
 Differentiate the absolute value function.
For more complex functions using the definition of the derivative would be an almost impossible task.
  Luckily for us we won t have to use the definition terribly often.
  We will have to use it on occasion, however we have a large collection of formulas and properties that we can use to simplify our life considerably and will allow us to avoid using the definition whenever possible.

Make sure that you can do the kind of work that we just did in this example.
  You will be asked numerous times over the course of the next two chapters to determine where functions are positive and or negative.
  If you need some review or want to practice these kinds of problems you should check out the Solving Inequalities section of my Algebra Trig Review.
