Database Models
Glossary
Database systems can be based on different data models or database models respectively. A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database. Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively. The most often used data models are:

Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively. The most often used data models are:
A model is a representation of reality, 'real world' objects and events, associations. It is an abstraction that concentrates on the essential, inherent aspects an organization and ignores the accidental properties. A data model represents the organization itself. It should provide the basic concepts and notations that will allow database designers and end users unambiguously and accurately to communicate their understanding of the organizational data.
