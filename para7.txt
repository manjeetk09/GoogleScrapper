Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage. For example, we have data player's name "Virat" and age 26. Here "Virat" is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type.

Some properties of abstract data types:
A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.

Some properties of abstract data types:
Double-ended queue


Simply you can group various built-in data types into a structure.
A structure in C is a collection of items of different types. You can think of a structure as a "record" is in Pascal or a class in Java without methods. Structures, or structs, are very useful in creating data structures larger and more complex than the ones we have discussed so far. Simply you can group various built-in data types into a structure. Object conepts was derived from Structure concept. You can achieve few object oriented goals using C structure but it is very complex.
