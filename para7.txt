An algebraic function is a function that can be written using a finite number of the basic operations of arithmetic (i.e., addition, multiplication, and exponentiation). In order to take the derivative of these functions, we will need the power rule.

In the first section of this chapter we saw the definition of the derivative and we computed a couple of derivatives using the definition.  As we saw in those examples there was a fair amount of work involved in computing the limits and the functions that we worked with were not terribly complicated.

For more complex functions using the definition of the derivative would be an almost impossible task.  Luckily for us we won’t have to use the definition terribly often.  We will have to use it on occasion, however we have a large collection of formulas and properties that we can use to simplify our life considerably and will allow us to avoid using the definition whenever possible.

Make sure that you can do the kind of work that we just did in this example.  You will be asked numerous times over the course of the next two chapters to determine where functions are positive and/or negative.  If you need some review or want to practice these kinds of problems you should check out the Solving Inequalities section of my Algebra/Trig Review.
