Supervised	VBN
learning	NN
is	VBZ
a	DT
type	NN
of	IN
machine	NN
learning	NN
algorithm	NN
that	WDT
uses	VBZ
a	DT
known	JJ
dataset	NN
called	VBD
the	DT
training	NN
dataset	NN
to	TO
make	VB
predictions	NNS
.	.

The	DT
training	NN
dataset	NN
includes	VBZ
input	NN
data	NNS
and	CC
response	NN
values	NNS
.	.

From	IN
it	PRP
the	DT
supervised	JJ
learning	NN
algorithm	NN
seeks	VBZ
to	TO
build	VB
a	DT
model	NN
that	WDT
can	MD
make	VB
predictions	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
response	NN
values	NNS
for	IN
a	DT
new	JJ
dataset	NN
.	.

A	DT
test	NN
dataset	NN
is	VBZ
often	RB
used	VBN
to	TO
validate	VB
the	DT
model	NN
.	.

Using	VBG
larger	JJR
training	NN
datasets	NNS
often	RB
yield	VBP
models	NNS
with	IN
higher	JJR
predictive	JJ
power	NN
that	WDT
can	MD
generalize	VB
well	RB
for	IN
new	JJ
datasets	NNS
