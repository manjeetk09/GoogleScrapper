Symmetric multiprocessing involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all I O devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes.
 Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture.
 In the case of multi_core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.

SMP is the processing of programs by multiple processors that share a common operating system and memory.
 In symmetric multiprocessing, the processors share memory and the I O bus or data path.
 A single copy of the operating system is in charge of all the processors.
 SMP, also known as a  shared everything  system, does not usually exceed 16 processors.

One of the easiest and cheapest ways to improve hardware performance is to put more than one CPU on the board.
 This can be done either making the different CPU s take on different jobs or by making them all run in parallel, doing the same job  symmetrical multi_processing, a.

 Doing asymmetrical multi_processing effectively requires specialized knowledge about the tasks the computer should do, which is unavailable in a general purpose operating system such as Linux.
 On the other hand, symmetrical multi_processing is relatively easy to implement.
Short for Symmetric Multiprocessing, a computer architecture that provides fast performance by making multiple CPUs available to complete individual processes simultaneously .
 Unlike asymmetrical processing, any idle processor can be assigned any task, and additional CPUs can be added to improve performance and handle increased loads.
 A variety of specialized operating systems and hardware arrangements are available to support SMP.
 Specific applications can benefit from SMP if the code allows multithreading.

Engineers contemplating a migration from a single_core to a multicore processor must identify where parallelism exists in their application.
 The next decision is how to partition the code over the cores of the device.
 The two main options are symmetric_multiprocessor mode and asymmetric_multiprocessor mode.
Or, different OSs may reside on the two cores.
 For example, if two previously separate processors are being collapsed onto one dual_core device, different OSs may reside on the two cores.

This scheme is still better than having n separate computers since itallows all the machines to share a set of disks and other I O devices, and italso allows the memory to be shared flexibly.
 For example, if one day anunusually large program has to be run, one of the CPUs can be allocated an extralarge portion of memory for the duration of that program.
 In addition, processescan efficiently communicate with one another by having, say a producer be ableto write data into memory and have a consumer fetch it from the place theproducer wrote it.
Our third model, the SMP , eliminatesthis asymmetry.
 There is one copy of the operating system in memory, but any CPUcan run it.
 When a system call is made, the CPU on which the system call wasmade traps to the kernel and processes the system call.
 The SMP model isillustrated in Fig.

AMP stands for Asymmetric Multi_Processing  SMP means Symmetric Multi_Processing.
 These terms are not at all transparent.
 In seeking a means to clarify, I thought I would check Wikipedia and looked up  AMP .
 From the disambiguation page, I found the relevant article.
 Well, I say  relevant , but it really does not cover the topic as we see it today.
 It talks about historical uses of multiple CPUs and dismisses it to history.
 So, I will try to advance definitions.
