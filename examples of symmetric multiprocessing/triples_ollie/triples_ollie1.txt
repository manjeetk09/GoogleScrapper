Symmetric multiprocessing involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all I O devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes.

SMP is the processing of programs by multiple processors that share a common operating system and memory.

 In symmetric multiprocessing, the processors share memory and the I O bus or data path.

One of the easiest and cheapest ways to improve hardware performance is to put more than one CPU on the board.

 Doing asymmetrical multi_processing effectively requires specialized knowledge about the tasks the computer should do, which is unavailable in a general purpose operating system such as Linux.

 On the other hand, symmetrical multi_processing is relatively easy to implement.

x, this isn t a problem because the entire kernel is in one big spinlock.
0.775: (the entire kernel; is in; one big spinlock)

 This means that if one CPU is in the kernel and another CPU wants to get in, for example because of a system call, it has to wait until the first CPU is done.
0.287: (it; has for; example)
0.192: (one CPU; is in; the kernel)

 This makes Linux SMP safe, but inefficient.

Short for Symmetric Multiprocessing, a computer architecture that provides fast performance by making multiple CPUs available to complete individual processes simultaneously .
0.563: (performance; be provides by; a computer architecture)
0.526: (multiple CPUs; be available to; complete individual processes)

 Unlike asymmetrical processing, any idle processor can be assigned any task, and additional CPUs can be added to improve performance and handle increased loads.

An SMP architecture is simply one where two or more identical processors connect to one another through a shared memory.
0.837: (An SMP architecture; is simply; one where two or more identical processors connect to one another through a shared memory)

 Each processor has equal access to the shared memory .

 For example, each processor has its own memory but also access to shared memory with a different access latency.

Asymmetric multiprocessing    In asymmetric multiprocessing the program tasks are strictly divided by type between processors and typically, each processor has its own memory address space.
