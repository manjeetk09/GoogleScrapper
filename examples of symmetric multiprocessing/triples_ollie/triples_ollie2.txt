Symmetric multiprocessing involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all I O devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes.
0.914: (two or more identical processors; are connected to; a single , shared main memory)
0.853: (Symmetric multiprocessing; involves; a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single , shared main memory)
0.621: (two or more identical processors; are connected in; a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture)
0.53: (all processors; be treats equally by; a single operating system instance)

 Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture.

SMP is the processing of programs by multiple processors that share a common operating system and memory.
0.884: (SMP; is the processing of; programs)
0.862: (SMP; is the processing of programs by; multiple processors)
0.668: (SMP; is; the processing of programs)

 In symmetric multiprocessing, the processors share memory and the I O bus or data path.

 A single copy of the operating system is in charge of all the processors.

One of the easiest and cheapest ways to improve hardware performance is to put more than one CPU on the board.
0.854: (One of the easiest and cheapest ways; is to put more than one CPU on; the board)

0.827: (One of the easiest and cheapest ways; to put more than one CPU on; the board)

 This can be done either making the different CPU s take on different jobs or by making them all run in parallel, doing the same job  symmetrical multi_processing, a.

 Doing asymmetrical multi_processing effectively requires specialized knowledge about the tasks the computer should do, which is unavailable in a general purpose operating system such as Linux.

 On the other hand, symmetrical multi_processing is relatively easy to implement.

0.572: (symmetrical multi_processing; is relatively easy on; the other hand)

Short for Symmetric Multiprocessing, a computer architecture that provides fast performance by making multiple CPUs available to complete individual processes simultaneously .
0.563: (performance; be provides by; a computer architecture)
0.526: (multiple CPUs; be available to; complete individual processes)

 Unlike asymmetrical processing, any idle processor can be assigned any task, and additional CPUs can be added to improve performance and handle increased loads.
0.757: (performance and handle; increased; loads)
0.679: (additional CPUs; can be assigned any task can unlike; asymmetrical processing)

 A variety of specialized operating systems and hardware arrangements are available to support SMP.

Engineers contemplating a migration from a single_core to a multicore processor must identify where parallelism exists in their application.

 The next decision is how to partition the code over the cores of the device.

Or, different OSs may reside on the two cores.

 For example, if two previously separate processors are being collapsed onto one dual_core device, different OSs may reside on the two cores.

This scheme is still better than having n separate computers since itallows all the machines to share a set of disks and other I O devices, and italso allows the memory to be shared flexibly.
0.701: (itallows all the machines; to share; a set of disks)

 For example, if one day anunusually large program has to be run, one of the CPUs can be allocated an extralarge portion of memory for the duration of that program.
0.937: (one of the CPUs; can be allocated an extralarge portion of memory for; the duration of that program)
0.831: (one of the CPUs; can be allocated; an extralarge portion of memory)
0.018: (one day anunusually large program; has for; example)

 In addition, processescan efficiently communicate with one another by having, say a producer be ableto write data into memory and have a consumer fetch it from the place theproducer wrote it.
0.834: (processescan; efficiently communicate with; one)
0.73: (a consumer; have fetch it from; the place theproducer)
0.704: (a producer; be; ableto)
0.655: (a consumer; have fetch; it)

0.602: (it; have fetch from; the place theproducer)
0.547: (a consumer; write data have into; memory)
0.545: (a consumer; write have; data)

Our third model, the SMP , eliminatesthis asymmetry.

 When a system call is made, the CPU on which the system call wasmade traps to the kernel and processes the system call.
