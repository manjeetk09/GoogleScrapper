0;1 Basic Message Passing IPC messaging lets processes send and receive messages, and queue messages for processing in an arbitrary order.
0; Unlike the file byte_stream data flow of pipes, each IPC message has an explicit length.
0; Messages can be assigned a specific type.
0; Because of this, a server process can direct message traffic between clients on its queue by using the client process PID as the message type.
0; For single_message transactions, multiple server processes can work in parallel on transactions sent to a shared message queue.
0;MPI is a directory of C programs which illustrate the use of MPI, the Message Passing Interface.

0;The Message Passing Interface Standard is a message passing library standard based on the consensus of the MPI Forum, which has over 40 participating organizations, including vendors, researchers, software library developers, and users.
0; The goal of the Message Passing Interface is to establish a portable, efficient, and flexible standard for message passing that will be widely used for writing message passing programs.
0; As such, MPI is the first standardized, vendor independent, message passing library.
0; The advantages of developing message passing software using MPI closely match the design goals of portability, efficiency, and flexibility.
0; MPI is not an IEEE or ISO standard, but has in fact, become the  industry standard  for writing message passing programs on HPC platforms.

0;The goal of this tutorial is to teach those unfamiliar with MPI how to develop and run parallel programs according to the MPI standard.
0; The primary topics that are presented focus on those which are the most useful for new MPI programmers.
0; The tutorial begins with an introduction, background, and basic information for getting started with MPI.
0; This is followed by a detailed look at the MPI routines that are most useful for new MPI programmers, including MPI Environment Management, Point_to_Point Communications, and Collective Communications routines.
0; Numerous examples in both C and Fortran are provided, as well as a lab exercise.
0;The tutorial materials also include more advanced topics such as Derived Data Types, Group and Communicator Management Routines, and Virtual Topologies.
0; However, these are not actually presented during the lecture, but are meant to serve as  further reading  for those who are interested.
0;Level Prerequisites.
0; This tutorial is ideal for those who are new to parallel programming with MPI.
0; A basic understanding of parallel programming in C or Fortran is required.
0; For those who are unfamiliar with Parallel Programming in general, the material covered in EC3500.
0; Introduction To Parallel Computing would be helpful.
0;An Interface Specification.
0; .
0; M P I   Message Passing Interface.
0; MPI is a specification for the developers and users of message passing libraries.
0; By itself, it is NOT a library _ but rather the specification of what such a library should be.
0; MPI primarily addresses the message_passing parallel programming model.
0; data is moved from the address space of one process to that of another process through cooperative operations on each process.
0; Simply stated, the goal of the Message Passing Interface is to provide a widely used standard for writing message passing programs.
0; The interface attempts to be.
0; Practical Portable Efficient Flexible.
0; The MPI standard has gone through a number of revisions, with the most recent version being MPI_3.
0;x.
0; Interface specifications have been defined for C and Fortran90 language bindings.
0; C   bindings from MPI_1 are removed in MPI_3 MPI_3 also provides support for Fortran 2003 and 2008 features.
0; Actual MPI library implementations differ in which version and features of the MPI standard they support.
0; Developers users will need to be aware of this.
0;Programming Model.
0; .
0; Originally, MPI was designed for distributed memory architectures, which were becoming increasingly popular at that time .
0; As architecture trends changed, shared memory SMPs were combined over networks creating hybrid distributed memory   shared memory systems.
0; MPI implementors adapted their libraries to handle both types of underlying memory architectures seamlessly.
0; They also adapted developed ways of handling different interconnects and protocols.
0; Today, MPI runs on virtually any hardware platform.
0; Distributed Memory Shared Memory Hybrid.
0; The programming model clearly remains a distributed memory model however, regardless of the underlying physical architecture of the machine.
0; All parallelism is explicit.
0; the programmer is responsible for correctly identifying parallelism and implementing parallel algorithms using MPI constructs.
0;Reasons for Using MPI.
0; .
0; Standardization _ MPI is the only message passing library that can be considered a standard.
0; It is supported on virtually all HPC platforms.
0; Practically, it has replaced all previous message passing libraries.
0; Portability _ There is little or no need to modify your source code when you port your application to a different platform that supports the MPI standard.
0; Performance Opportunities _ Vendor implementations should be able to exploit native hardware features to optimize performance.
0; Any implementation is free to develop optimized algorithms.
0; Functionality _ There are over 430 routines defined in MPI_3, which includes the majority of those in MPI_2 and MPI_1.
0;  Most MPI programs can be written using a dozen or less routines.
0; Availability _ A variety of implementations are available, both vendor and public domain.
0; .
0; MPI has resulted from the efforts of numerous individuals and groups that began in 1992.
0; Some history.
0; 1980s _ early 1990s.
0; Distributed memory, parallel computing develops, as do a number of incompatible software tools for writing such programs _ usually with tradeoffs between portability, performance, functionality and price.
0; Recognition of the need for a standard arose.
0; Apr 1992.
0; Workshop on Standards for Message Passing in a Distributed Memory Environment, sponsored by the Center for Research on Parallel Computing, Williamsburg, Virginia.
0; The basic features essential to a standard message passing interface were discussed, and a working group established to continue the standardization process.
0; Preliminary draft proposal developed subsequently.
0; Nov 1992.
0; Working group meets in Minneapolis.
0; MPI draft proposal from ORNL presented.
0; Group adopts procedures and organization to form the MPI Forum.
0; It eventually comprised of about 175 individuals from 40 organizations including parallel computer vendors, software writers, academia and application scientists.

0; .
0;Format of MPI Calls.
0; .
0; C names are case sensitive  Fortran names are not.
0; Programs must not declare variables or functions with names beginning with the prefix MPI_ or PMPI_ .
0; C Binding Format.

0;, ierr  Example.
0; CALL MPI_BSENDError code.
0; Returned as  ierr  parameter.
0; MPI_SUCCESS if successful.
0;Communicators and Groups.
0; .
0; MPI uses objects called communicators and groups to define which collection of processes may communicate with each other.
0; Most MPI routines require you to specify a communicator as an argument.
0; Communicators and groups will be covered in more detail later.
0; For now, simply use MPI_COMM_WORLD whenever a communicator is required _ it is the predefined communicator that includes all of your MPI processes.
0;Rank.
0; .
0; Within a communicator, every process has its own unique, integer identifier assigned by the system when the process initializes.
0; A rank is sometimes also called a  task ID .
0; Ranks are contiguous and begin at zero.
0; Used by the programmer to specify the source and destination of messages.
0; Often used conditionally by the application to control program execution .
0;Error Handling.
0; .
0; Most MPI routines include a return error code parameter, as described in the  Format of MPI Calls  section above.
0; However, according to the MPI standard, the default behavior of an MPI call is to abort if there is an error.
0; This means you will probably not be able to capture a return error code other than MPI_SUCCESS .
0; The standard does provide a means to override this default error handler.
0; A discussion on how to do this is available HERE.
0; You can also consult the error handling section of the relevant MPI Standard documentation located at http.
0;  www.
0;mpi_forum.
0;org docs .
0; The types of errors displayed to the user are implementation dependent.
0;This group of routines is used for interrogating and setting the MPI execution environment, and covers an assortment of purposes, such as initializing and terminating the MPI environment, querying a rank s identity, querying the MPI library s version, etc.

0;Order and Fairness.
0; Order.
0; MPI guarantees that messages will not overtake each other.
0; If a sender sends two messages in succession to the same destination, and both match the same receive, the receive operation will receive Message 1 before Message 2.
0; If a receiver posts two receives , in succession, and both are looking for the same message, Receive 1 will receive the message before Receive 2.
0; Order rules do not apply if there are multiple threads participating in the communication operations.
0; Fairness.
0; MPI does not guarantee fairness _ it s up to the programmer to prevent  operation starvation .
0; Example.
0; task 0 sends a message to task 2.
0; However, task 1 sends a competing message that matches task 2 s receive.
0; Only one of the sends will complete.
0; Blocking sends MPI_SendNon_blocking sends MPI_IsendBlocking receive MPI_RecvNon_blocking receive MPI_Irecv.
0;Notes.
0; Programmers may also create their own data types .
0; MPI_BYTE and MPI_PACKED do not correspond to standard C or Fortran types.

0;Types of Collective Operations.
0; .
0; Synchronization _ processes wait until all members of the group have reached the synchronization point.
0; Data Movement _ broadcast, scatter gather, all to all.
0; Collective Computation _ one member of the group collects data from the other members and performs an operation  min, max, add, multiply, etc.
0;  on that data.
0;Scope.
0; .
0; Collective communication routines must involve all processes within the scope of a communicator.
0; All processes are by default, members in the communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD.
0; Additional communicators can be defined by the programmer.
0; See the Group and Communicator Management Routines section for details.
0; Unexpected behavior, including program failure, can occur if even one task in the communicator doesn t participate.
0; It is the programmer s responsibility to ensure that all processes within a communicator participate in any collective operations.
0;Programming Considerations and Restrictions.
0; .
0; Collective communication routines do not take message tag arguments.
0; Collective operations within subsets of processes are accomplished by first partitioning the subsets into new groups and then attaching the new groups to new communicators .
0; Can only be used with MPI predefined datatypes _ not with MPI Derived Data Types.
0; MPI_2 extended most collective operations to allow data movement between intercommunicators .
0; With MPI_3, collective operations can be blocking or non_blocking.

0; .
0; Note from the MPI_Reduce man page.
0; The operation is always assumed to be associative.
0; All predefined operations are also assumed to be commutative.
0; Users may define operations that are assumed to be associative, but not commutative.
0; The  canonical  evaluation order of a reduction is determined by the ranks of the processes in the group.
0; However, the implementation can take advantage of associativity, or associativity and commutativity in order to change the order of evaluation.
0; This may change the result of the reduction for operations that are not strictly associative and commutative, such as floating point addition.
0;  Advice to implementors  It is strongly recommended that MPI_REDUCE be implemented so that the same result be obtained whenever the function is applied on the same arguments, appearing in the same order.
0; Note that this may prevent optimizations that take advantage of the physical location of processors.

0;Groups vs.
0; Communicators.
0; .
0; A group is an ordered set of processes.
0; Each process in a group is associated with a unique integer rank.
0; Rank values start at zero and go to N_1, where N is the number of processes in the group.
0; In MPI, a group is represented within system memory as an object.
0; It is accessible to the programmer only by a  handle .
0; A group is always associated with a communicator object.
0; A communicator encompasses a group of processes that may communicate with each other.
0; All MPI messages must specify a communicator.
0; In the simplest sense, the communicator is an extra  tag  that must be included with MPI calls.
0; Like groups, communicators are represented within system memory as objects and are accessible to the programmer only by  handles .
0; For example, the handle for the communicator that comprises all tasks is MPI_COMM_WORLD.
0; From the programmer s perspective, a group and a communicator are one.
0; The group routines are primarily used to specify which processes should be used to construct a communicator.
0;Primary Purposes of Group and Communicator Objects.
0;Programming Considerations and Restrictions.
0; .
0; Groups communicators are dynamic _ they can be created and destroyed during program execution.
0; Processes may be in more than one group communicator.
0; They will have a unique rank within each group communicator.
0; MPI provides over 40 routines related to groups, communicators, and virtual topologies.
0; Typical usage.
0; Extract handle of global group from MPI_COMM_WORLD using MPI_Comm_group Form new group as a subset of global group using MPI_Group_incl Create new communicator for new group using MPI_Comm_create Determine new rank in new communicator using MPI_Comm_rank Conduct communications using any MPI message passing routine When finished, free up new communicator and group using MPI_Comm_free and MPI_Group_free.
0;Create two different process groups for separate collective communications exchange.
0; Requires creating new communicators also.
0;What Are They  .
0; In terms of MPI, a virtual topology describes a mapping ordering of MPI processes into a geometric  shape .
0; The two main types of topologies supported by MPI are Cartesian and Graph.
0; MPI topologies are virtual _ there may be no relation between the physical structure of the parallel machine and the process topology.
0; Virtual topologies are built upon MPI communicators and groups.
0; Must be  programmed  by the application developer.
0;Why Use Them  .
0; Convenience Virtual topologies may be useful for applications with specific communication patterns _ patterns that match an MPI topology structure.
0; For example, a Cartesian topology might prove convenient for an application that requires 4_way nearest neighbor communications for grid based data.
0; Communication Efficiency Some hardware architectures may impose penalties for communications between successively distant  nodes .
0; A particular implementation may optimize process mapping based upon the physical characteristics of a given parallel machine.
0; The mapping of processes into an MPI virtual topology is dependent upon the MPI implementation, and may be totally ignored.
0;Example.
0; A simplified mapping of processes into a Cartesian virtual topology appears below.

0;A simplified mapping of processes into a Cartesian virtual topology appears below.
0;Create a 4 x 4 Cartesian topology from 16 processors and have each process exchange its rank with four neighbors.
0;MPI_2.
0; .
0; Intentionally, the MPI_1 specification did not address several  difficult  issues.
0; For reasons of expediency, these issues were deferred to a second specification, called MPI_2 in 1998.
0; MPI_2 was a major revision to MPI_1 adding new functionality and corrections.
0; Key areas of new functionality in MPI_2.
0; Dynamic Processes _ extensions that remove the static process model of MPI.
0; Provides routines to create new processes after job startup.

0;The value of PI can be calculated in various ways  Consider the Monte Carlo method of approximating PI  Inscribe a circle with radius r in a square with side length of 2r The area of the circle is  r2 and the area of the square is 4r2 The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is   r2   4r2       4 If you randomly generate N points inside the square, approximately N       4 of those points should fall inside the circle    is then approximated as  N       4   M     4   M   N     4   M   N Note that increasing the number of points generated improves the approximation .

0;Note that increasing the number of points generated improves the approximation .
0;Break the loop iterations into chunks that can be executed by different tasks simultaneously .
0;Each task executes its portion of the loop a number of times .
0;Each task can do its work without requiring any information from the other tasks  .
0;Master task recieves results from other tasks using send receive point_to_point operations .
0;MPI point_to_point operations typically involve message passing between two, and only two, different MPI tasks  One task is performing a send operation and the other task is performing a matching receive operation .
0;There are different types of send and receive routines used for different purposes  For example  Synchronous send Blocking send   blocking receive Non_blocking send   non_blocking receive Buffered send Combined send receive  Ready  send.
0;Any type of send routine can be paired with any type of receive routine .
0;MPI also provides several routines associated with send _ receive operations, such as those used to wait for a message s arrival or probe to find out if a message has arrived .
0;Synchronous send.
0;Blocking send   blocking receive.
0;Non_blocking send   non_blocking receive.
0;Buffered send.
0;Combined send receive.
0; Ready  send.
0;In a perfect world, every send operation would be perfectly synchronized with its matching receive  This is rarely the case  Somehow or other, the MPI implementation must be able to deal with storing data when the two tasks are out of sync .
0;Consider the following two cases  A send operation occurs 5 seconds before the receive is ready _ where is the message while the receive is pending  Multiple sends arrive at the same receiving task which can only accept one send at a time _ what happens to the messages that are  backing up  .
0;The MPI implementation decides what happens to data in these types of cases  Typically, a system buffer area is reserved to hold data in transit  For example .
0;System buffer space is  Opaque to the programmer and managed entirely by the MPI library A finite resource that can be easy to exhaust Often mysterious and not well documented Able to exist on the sending side, the receiving side, or both Something that may improve program performance because it allows send _ receive operations to be asynchronous .
0;User managed address space is called the application buffer  MPI also provides for a user managed send buffer .
0;A send operation occurs 5 seconds before the receive is ready _ where is the message while the receive is pending .
0;Multiple sends arrive at the same receiving task which can only accept one send at a time _ what happens to the messages that are  backing up  .

0;Often mysterious and not well documented.
0;Able to exist on the sending side, the receiving side, or both.
0;Something that may improve program performance because it allows send _ receive operations to be asynchronous .
0;Most of the MPI point_to_point routines can be used in either blocking or non_blocking mode .
0;Blocking  A blocking send routine will only  return  after it is safe to modify the application buffer for reuse  Safe means that modifications will not affect the data intended for the receive task  Safe does not imply that the data was actually received _ it may very well be sitting in a system buffer  A blocking send can be synchronous which means there is handshaking occurring with the receive task to confirm a safe send  A blocking send can be asynchronous if a system buffer is used to hold the data for eventual delivery to the receive  A blocking receive only  returns  after the data has arrived and is ready for use by the program .
0;Non_blocking  Non_blocking send and receive routines behave similarly _ they will return almost immediately  They do not wait for any communication events to complete, such as message copying from user memory to system buffer space or the actual arrival of message  Non_blocking operations simply  request  the MPI library to perform the operation when it is able  The user can not predict when that will happen  It is unsafe to modify the application buffer until you know for a fact the requested non_blocking operation was actually performed by the library  There are  wait  routines used to do this  Non_blocking communications are primarily used to overlap computation with communication and exploit possible performance gains  Blocking Send Non_blocking Send   myvar   0     for       task   i      MPI_Send       myvar   myvar   2          do some work                  myvar   0     for       task   i      MPI_Isend       myvar   myvar   2           do some work          MPI_Wait             Safe  Why  Unsafe  Why .
