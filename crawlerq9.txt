It looks like this.
when x is less than 2, it gives x2,.
when x is exactly 2 it gives 6.
when x is more than 2 and less than or equal to 6 it gives the line 10_x.
You may be asked to write a piecewise function, given a graph.
  Now that we know what piecewise functions are all about, it s not that bad  To review how to obtain equations from linear graphs, see Obtaining the Equations of a Line, and from quadratics, see Finding a Quadratic Equation from Points or a Graph.
 Here are the graphs, with explanations on how to derive their piecewise equations.
Some Simple Examples.
Besides evaluating limits, you can do operations such as computing derivatives, integrating, and solving differential equations with piecewise functions.
 Examples of solving DEs will be illustrated later.
 Using the same function, f, find its piecewise derivative.
