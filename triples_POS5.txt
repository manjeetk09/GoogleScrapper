A	DT
Database	NN
model	NN
defines	VBZ
the	DT
logical	JJ
design	NN
of	IN
data	NNS
.	.

The	DT
model	NN
describes	VBZ
the	DT
relationships	NNS
between	IN
different	JJ
parts	NNS
of	IN
the	DT
data	NNS
.	.

Historically	NNP
in	IN
database	NN
design	NN
three	CD
models	NNS
are	VBP
commonly	RB
used	VBN
.	.

They	PRP
are	VBP

In	IN
the	DT
network	NN
model	NN
entities	NNS
are	VBP
organised	VBN
in	IN
a	DT
graph	NN
in	IN
which	WDT
some	DT
entities	NNS
can	MD
be	VB
accessed	VBN
through	IN
several	JJ
path	NN

The	DT
Network	NNP
model	NN
replaces	VBZ
the	DT
hierarchical	JJ
tree	NN
with	IN
a	DT
graph	NN
thus	RB
allowing	VBG
more	JJR
general	JJ
connections	NNS
among	IN
the	DT
nodes	NNS
.	.

The	DT
main	JJ
difference	NN
of	IN
the	DT
network	NN
model	NN
from	IN
the	DT
hierarchical	JJ
model	NN
is	VBZ
its	PRP$
ability	NN
to	TO
handle	VB
many	JJ
to	TO
many	JJ
N	NN
N	NN
relations	NNS
.	.

In	IN
other	JJ
words	NNS
it	PRP
allows	VBZ
a	DT
record	NN
to	TO
have	VB
more	JJR
than	IN
one	CD
parent	NN
.	.

Suppose	VB
an	DT
employee	NN
works	VBZ
for	IN
two	CD
departments	NNS
.	.

The	DT
strict	JJ
hierarchical	JJ
arrangement	NN
is	VBZ
not	RB
possible	JJ
here	RB
and	CC
the	DT
tree	NN
becomes	VBZ
a	DT
more	RBR
generalized	VBN
graph	NN
a	DT
network	NN
.	.

The	DT
network	NN
model	NN
was	VBD
evolved	VBN
to	TO
specifically	RB
handle	VB
non	JJ
hierarchical	JJ
relationships	NNS

As	IN
shown	VBN
below	IN
data	NNS
can	MD
belong	VB
to	TO
more	JJR

Note	VB
that	IN
there	EX

A	DT
