Supervised and unsupervised are related to learning, which may use any search or optimization tool like genetic algorithm, gradient based algorithm etc.
No extractions found.

Supervised learning algorithms are ones for which we have some known labels on our inputs , whereas in unsupervised learning we don t have any known outputs.
0.739: (we; have; some known labels)
0.636: (t; have; any known outputs)

 Regardless, in both cases we need to learn the parameters that relate the input to the output.
