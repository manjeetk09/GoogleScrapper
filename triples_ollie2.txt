Think back to when you were in elementary school.
0.937: (you; were in; elementary school)

 Your teacher gave you worksheets containing statements like     2   4  and told you to fill in the box.
0.926: (Your teacher; told you to fill in; the box)
0.887: (Your teacher; gave you; worksheets containing statements like 2 4)
0.812: (Your teacher; told; you)
0.771: (Your teacher; to fill in; the box)

 Once you got older, your teacher started giving you worksheets containing statements like  x   2   4  and told you to  solve for x .
0.814: (your teacher; started giving you; worksheets containing statements like x 2 4)
0.8: (your teacher; told you to solve for; x)
0.683: (your teacher; to solve for; x)
