Database design is a process of modeling an enterprise in the real world.
0.792: (Database design; is; a process modeling an enterprise in the real world)
0.674: (an enterprise; be modeling in; the real world)

 In fact, a database itself is a model of the real world that contains selected information needed by the enterprise.
0.909: (a database; is a model of; the real world)
0.782: (selected information; be needed by; the enterprise)
0.752: (a database; is; a model of the real world that contains selected information)
0.628: (selected information needed by the enterprise; be contains by; a model of the real world)
0.446: (a database; is a model of the real world in; fact)

 Many models and languages some formally and mathematically defined, some informal and intuitive are used by designers.

 Today, there are many commercial Relational Database Management System , such as Oracle, IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

In the relational model, a table cannot contain duplicate rows, because that would create ambiguities in retrieval.
0.648: (a table cannot; contain; duplicate rows)[enabler=because that would create ambiguities in retrieval]
0.405: (a table cannot; contain duplicate rows , in; the relational model)[enabler=because that would create ambiguities in retrieval]

 To ensure uniqueness, each table should have a column , called primary key, that uniquely identifies every records of the table.
0.773: (each table; should have; a column)
0.62: (every records of the table; be uniquely identifies by; primary key)

 For example, an unique number customerID can be used as the primary key for the Customers table  productCode for Products table  isbn for Books table.
0.925: (an unique number customerID; can be used as; the primary key)
0.46: (an unique number customerID; can be used for; example)

 A primary key is called a simple key if it is a single column  it is called a composite key if it is made up of several columns.
0.799: (A primary key; is called; a simple key if it is a single column it is called a composite key if it is made up of several columns)
0.687: (it; is called; a composite key)[enabler=if it is a single column it is called a composite key if it is made up of several columns]
0.542: (it; is called a composite key in; a simple key)[enabler=if it is a single column it is called a composite key if it is made up of several columns]
0.255: (it; is made of; several columns)
0.06: (it; is; a single column)

A Database model defines the logical design of data.

 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.

0.303: (different; be parts of; the data)

 Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
