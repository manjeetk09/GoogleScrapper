A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree_like structure.

0.802: (A hierarchical database model; is; a data model in which the data is organized into a tree_like structure)
0.71: (the data; is organized in; a data model)

 The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links.

 A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value.

0.907: (A record; is a collection of fields with; each field containing only one value)
0.736: (A record; is; a collection of fields)

 The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.
