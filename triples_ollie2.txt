In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables.
0.936: (a plane real algebraic curve; is the set of; points)
0.932: (whose coordinates; are zeros of; some polynomial)
0.906: (whose coordinates; are zeros of some polynomial in; two variables)
0.794: (a plane real algebraic curve; is; the set of points)
0.746: (a plane real algebraic curve; is the set of points in; mathematics)

 More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.

Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs connected by some points sometimes called  remarkable points .

0.655: (smooth monotone arcs; be connected by; some points)

 A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis.
0.953: (A smooth monotone arc; is the graph of; a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis)
0.736: (A smooth monotone arc; is; the graph of a smooth function)
0.53: (a smooth function which is defined; be monotone on; an open interval of the x_axis)

 In each direction, an arc is either unbounded or has an end point which is either a singular point or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the  complete  curve.
0.926: (the affine curve; is a part of; the projective curve that is large enough to well define the complete curve)
0.621: (the affine curve; is; a part of the projective curve)

 This point of view is commonly expressed by calling  points at infinity  of the affine curve the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.
0.437: (points; calling the points of the projective completion that do not belong to be the affine part at; infinity of the affine curve)

There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
No extractions found.

 Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0.564: (the graphs; be produces by; its own type of function)

 They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0.796: (you; can get; an idea what a graph might look like)

 The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.

These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves.
0.821: (These functions; produce more interesting graphs with; more curves)
0.793: (These functions; produce; interesting graphs)

 The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.
