 It works around real world entities and the associations among them.

An entity relationship model  ER model  describes inter related things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge.
0.854: (An entity relationship model ER model; describes; inter related things of interest)
0.841: (An entity relationship model ER model; describes of; interest)

 An ER model is composed of entity types  which classify the things of interest  and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types.

An entity relationship model is usually the result of systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of a business.
0.955: (An entity relationship model; is usually the result of; systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of a business)
0.838: (An entity relationship model; is usually; the result of systematic analysis)

 It does not define the business processes  it only presents a business data schema in graphical form.
0.64: (It; does not define; the business)

 It is usually drawn in a graphical form as boxes  entities  that are connected by lines  relationships  which express the associations and dependencies between entities.

0.42: (graphical; be form as; boxes entities that are connected by lines relationships)

 An ER model can also be expressed in a verbal form  for example  one building may be divided into zero or more apartments  but one apartment can only be located in one building.
