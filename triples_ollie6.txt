A binary tree is an important type of structure which occurs very often.

 For binary trees we distinguish between the subtree on the left and on the right, whereas for trees the order of the subtreewas irrelevant.
0.784: (we; distinguish between; the subtree)

 Also a binary tree may have zero nodes.
0.727: (a binary tree; Also may have; zero nodes)

 Thus a binary tree is really a different object than a tree.
0.889: (a binary tree; Thus is really a different object than; a tree)

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which at every level, except possibly the last, has to be completely filled and all nodes are as far left as possible..

A binary tree can be converted into an extended binary tree by adding new nodes to its leaf nodes and to the nodes that have only one child. These new nodes are added in such a way that all the nodes in the resultant tree have either zero or two children. It is also called 2 – tree..
0.929: (A binary tree; can be converted into; an extended binary tree)

0.617: (It; is also called; 2)
0.587: (new nodes; be adding to; its leaf nodes and to the nodes that have only one child)

Threaded Binary tree is the tree which is represented using pointers the empty sub trees are set to NULL, i.e. ‘left’ pointer of the node whose left child is empty sub tree is normally set to NULL. These large numbers of pointer sets are used in different ways..

 In this lesson, we have discussed binary tree in detail.
0.771: (we; have discussed binary; tree)
0.453: (we; have discussed in; this lesson)

 We have talked about different types of binary tree like "complete binary tree", "perfect binary tree" and "balanced binary tree" and their properties.
0.832: (We; have talked about; different types of binary tree)
0.544: (We; have "balanced binary; tree)

 We have also discussed how cost of operations in a tree may depend upon height of the tree and why we want a tree to be dense and its height to be minimum.
0.847: (cost of operations; may depend upon; height of the tree)
0.705: (cost of operations; may want; a tree to be dense and its height)
0.627: (we; may depend upon; height of the tree)
0.597: (we; may want; a tree to be dense and its height)

 Finally, we talked about two possible implementations of binary tree _ a) using dynamically created nodes and b) using arrays.

 Whereas arrays arrange data linearly, binary trees can be envisioned as storing data in two dimensions.

 A special kind of binary tree, called a binary search tree, or BST, allows for a much more optimized search time than with arrays.
