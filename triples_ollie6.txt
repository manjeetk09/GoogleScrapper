Here we are going to design an Entity Relationship  model for a college database .
0.685: (we; to design; an Entity Relationship model)

The ER model defines the conceptual view of a database.
0.833: (The ER model; defines; the conceptual view of a database)

 It works around realworld entities and the associations among them.
0.809: (It; works around; realworld entities and the associations)

 At view level, the ER model is considered a good option for designing databases.
0.778: (the ER model; is considered; a good option)
0.754: (the ER model; is considered at; view level)

Let us now learn how the ER Model is represented by means of an ER diagram.
0.946: (the ER Model; is represented by; means of an ER diagram)

 Any object, for example, entities, attributes of an entity, relationship sets, and attributes of relationship sets, can be represented with the help of an ER diagram.
0.937: (entities , attributes of an entity , relationship sets , and attributes of relationship sets; can be represented with; the help of an ER diagram)
0.888: (Any object; can be represented with; the help of an ER diagram)
0.691: (attributes of an entity; be attributes of; relationship sets)
0.482: (Any object; can be represented for; example)
0.46: (entities , attributes of an entity , relationship sets , and attributes of relationship sets; can be represented for; example)

An entity relationship model  describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge.

Entity relationship modeling was developed for database design by Peter Chen and published in a 1976 paper.
0.929: (Entity relationship modeling; was developed for; database design)
0.898: (Entity relationship modeling; be published in; a 1976 paper)

 However, variants of the idea existed previously.

 Some ER modelers show super and subtype entities connected by generalizationspecialization relationships, and an ER model can be used also in the specification of domainspecific ontologies.

An entity relationship model is usually the result of systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of a business.
0.955: (An entity relationship model; is usually the result of; systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of a business)
0.838: (An entity relationship model; is usually; the result of systematic analysis)

 It does not define the business processes  it only presents a business data schema in graphical form.
0.64: (It; does not define; the business)

 It is usually drawn in a graphical form as boxes  that are connected by lines  which express the associations and dependencies between entities.
0.891: (It; is usually drawn in; a graphical form)
0.686: (lines; express the associations between; entities)
0.601: (lines; express dependencies between; entities)
0.42: (graphical; be form as; boxes that are connected by lines)

 An ER model can also be expressed in a verbal form, for example  one building may be divided into zero or more apartments, but one apartment can only be located in one building.
0.914: (one apartment; can only be located in; one building)
0.9: (An ER model; can also be expressed in; a verbal form)
0.874: (An ER model; can also be expressed for; example one building)
0.595: (one apartment; can only be located at; one building)
0.594: (one apartment; can only be located on; one building)
