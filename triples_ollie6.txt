The types of the database models generally used in the business organizations can be categorized as follows  .
0.587: (the database models; be generally used in; the business organizations)

There are three types of database models which are common in the industry.
No extractions found.

  They are the Hierarchical Data Model, the Network Data Model and the Relational Data Model.
No extractions found.

 These models have their own particular nature, and, therefore, they are applicable in the industry where a similar situation exists.

 There is fourth model known as the Object Data Based Model in which data is structured as objects at a much higher level as compared to the other models providing flexibility in designing the application.
