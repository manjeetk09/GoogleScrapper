Sunil Ray says  August 14, 2015 at 7 36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment  
Dalila says  August 14, 2015 at 1 35 pm Very good summary  Thank  One simple point  The reason for taking the log  in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I e , easy to solve  Sunil Ray says  August 21, 2015 at 5 21 am Thanks Dalila    Borun Chowdhury says  April 21, 2016 at 8 48 am That s not the reason for taking the log  The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes  First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias  However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable  The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason  Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention  Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p  fsuch that p 0 and p 0  It so happens that this is satisfied by p  exp    which can be re_written as log     a x  b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point  One should ask is why we don t use least square method  The reason is that a yes no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process  For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the  true  function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method  So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates  Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions 
Statis says  August 19, 2015 at 12 14 am Nice summary   Huzefa  you shouldn t replace the     in the R code, it basically means  as a function of   You can also keep the     right after, it stands for  all other variables in the dataset provided   If you want to be explicit, you can write y   x1   x2     where x1, x2    are the names of the columns of your data frame or data table  Further note on formula specification  by default R adds an intercept, so that y   x is equivalent to y   1   x, you can remove it via y   0   x  Interactions are specified with either   or     y   x1   x2 is equivalent to y   x1   x2   x1   x2  Hope this helps 
Chris says  August 26, 2015 at 1 01 am You did a Wonderful job  This is really helpful  Thanks 
Glenn Nelson says  September 10, 2015 at 7 48 pm I took the Stanford_Coursera ML class, but have not used it, and I found this to be an incredibly useful summary  I appreciate the real_world analogues, such as your mention of Jezzball  And showing the brief code snips is terrific 
Shankar Pandala says  September 15, 2015 at 12 09 pm This is very easy and helpful than any other courses I have completed  simple  clear  To the point

Baha says  November 27, 2015 at 1 13 pm Well done, Thank you 
Benjamin says  December 5, 2015 at 7 00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work  Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong  It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability  it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression  As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example  I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1  Thanks for the great article overall

Pansy says  March 8, 2016 at 3 04 pm I have to thank you for this informative summary  Really useful 
J says  March 10, 2016 at 8 54 pm Somewhat irresponsible article since it does not mention any measure of performance and only gives cooking recipes without understanding what algorithm does what and the stats behind it  Cooking recipes like these are the ones that place people in Drew Conway s danger zone , thus making programmers the worst data analysts   I highly recommend anyone wishing to enter into this brave new world not to jump into statistical learning without proper statistical background  Otherwise you could end up like Google, Target, Telefonica, or Google and become a poster boy for  The Big Flops of Big Data   George says  June 17, 2016 at 1 34 pm Do you have a better article Please share 
Robin White says  March 15, 2016 at 11 38 pm Great article  It really summarize some of the most important topics on machine learning  But as asked above I would like to present thedevmasters com as a company with a really good course to learn more depth about machine learning with great professors and a sense of community that is always helping itself to continue learning even after the course ends 
salman ahmed says  March 19, 2016 at 8 29 am awesome , recommended this article to all my friends
Borun Chowdhury says  April 21, 2016 at 8 13 am Very succinct description of some important algorithms  Thanks  I d like to point out a mistake in the SVM section  You say  where each point has two co_ordinates    This is not correct, the coordinates are just features  Its the points lying on the margin that are called the  support vectors   These are the points that  support  the margin i e  define it

nd says  June 17, 2016 at 7 39 am Very good information interms of initial knowledge Note one warning, many methods can be fitted into a particular problem, but result might not be what you wish  Hence you must always compare models, understand residuals profile and how prediction really predicts  In that sense, analysis of data is never ending  In R, use summary, plot and check for assumptions validity
