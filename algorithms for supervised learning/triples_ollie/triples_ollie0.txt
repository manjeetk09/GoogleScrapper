Dalila says  August 14, 2015 at 1 35 pm Very good summary  Thank  One simple point  The reason for taking the log  in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I e , easy to solve  Sunil Ray says  August 21, 2015 at 5 21 am Thanks Dalila    Borun Chowdhury says  April 21, 2016 at 8 48 am That s not the reason for taking the log  The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes  First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias  However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable  The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason  Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention  Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p  fsuch that p 0 and p 0  It so happens that this is satisfied by p  exp    which can be re_written as log     a x  b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point  One should ask is why we don t use least square method  The reason is that a yes no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process  For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the  true  function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method  So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates  Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions .

Machine learning algorithms can be divided into 3 broad categories   supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
0.9: (Machine learning algorithms; can be divided into; 3 broad categories)

Supervised learning is useful in cases where a property is available for a certain dataset , but is missing and needs to be predicted for other instances.
0.882: (Supervised learning; is useful in; cases where a property is available for a certain dataset)
0.851: (needs; to be predicted for; other instances)
0.824: (a property; is available for; a certain dataset)
0.778: (a property; is; available)
0.777: (Supervised learning; is; useful)

 Unsupervised learning is useful in cases where the challenge is to discover implicit relationships in a given unlabeled dataset .
0.888: (Unsupervised learning; is useful in; cases where the challenge is to discover implicit relationships in a given unlabeled dataset)
0.798: (the challenge; is to discover; implicit relationships)
0.746: (Unsupervised learning; is; useful)

 Reinforcement learning falls between these 2 extremes   there is some form of feedback available for each predictive step or action, but no precise label or error message.
No extractions found.

 Since this is an intro class, I didn t learn about reinforcement learning, but I hope that 10 algorithms on supervised and unsupervised learning will be enough to keep you interested.
0.64: (t; learn about; reinforcement learning)

In the data science course that I instruct, we cover most of the data science pipeline but focus especially on machine learning.

0.372: (we; cover most of the data science pipeline but focus especially on machine learning in; the data science course)[enabler=that I instruct]

 Besides teaching model evaluation procedures and metrics, we obviously teach the algorithms themselves, primarily for supervised learning.
