 This allows for an easy utilization of inference rules of the well_known inductive learning methodology, which replace the traditional domain_independent operators and make the search task_specific.

 Moreover, a closer relationship between the underlying task and the processing mechanisms provides a setting for an application of more powerful task_specific heuristics.

 The method of abstracting the genetic algorithm to the problem level, described here for the supervised inductive learning, can be also extended to other domains and tasks, since it provides a framework for combining recently popular genetic algorithm methods with traditional problem_solving methodologies.
