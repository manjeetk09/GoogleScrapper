0;Genetic Algorithms can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning, e.
0;g.
0;Supervised learning in attribute_based spaces is one of the most popular machine learning problems studied and, consequently, has attracted considerable attention of the genetic algorithm community.
0; The full_memory approach developed here uses the same high_level descriptive language that is used in rule_based systems.
0; This allows for an easy utilization of inference rules of the well_known inductive learning methodology, which replace the traditional domain_independent operators and make the search task_specific.
0; Moreover, a closer relationship between the underlying task and the processing mechanisms provides a setting for an application of more powerful task_specific heuristics.
0; Initial results obtained with a prototype implementation for the simplest case of single concepts indicate that genetic algorithms can be effectively used to process high_level concepts and incorporate task_specific knowledge.
0; The method of abstracting the genetic algorithm to the problem level, described here for the supervised inductive learning, can be also extended to other domains and tasks, since it provides a framework for combining recently popular genetic algorithm methods with traditional problem_solving methodologies.
0; Moreover, in this particular case, it provides a very powerful tool enabling study of the widely accepted but not so well understood inductive learning methodology.
0;Supervised learning algorithms are ones for which we have some known labels on our inputs , whereas in unsupervised learning we don t have any known outputs.
0; Regardless, in both cases we need to learn the parameters that relate the input to the output.
