Machine learning


Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset (called the training dataset) to make predictions. The training dataset includes input data and response values. From it, the supervised learning algorithm seeks to build a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset. A test dataset is often used to validate the model. Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks! Glenn Nelson says: September 10, 2015 at 7:48 pm I took the Stanford-Coursera ML class, but have not used it, and I found this to be an incredibly useful summary. I appreciate the real-world analogues, such as your mention of Jezzball. And showing the brief code snips is terrific. Shankar Pandala says: September 15, 2015 at 12:09 pm This is very easy and helpful than any other courses I have completed. simple. clear.

Just, can you add Neural Network here in simple terms with example and code. Sayan Putatunda says: November 1, 2015 at 7:00 am Errata:- fit <- kmeans(X, 3) # 5 cluster solution It`s a 3 cluster solution. Baha says: November 27, 2015 at 1:13 pm Well done, Thank you! Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

J says: March 10, 2016 at 8:54 pm Somewhat irresponsible article since it does not mention any measure of performance and only gives cooking recipes without understanding what algorithm does what and the stats behind it.

I highly recommend anyone wishing to enter into this brave new world not to jump into statistical learning without proper statistical background. Otherwise you could end up like Google, Target, Telefonica, or Google (again) and become a poster boy for “The Big Flops of Big Data”.

This is not correct, the coordinates are just features. Its the points lying on the margin that are called the ‘support vectors’. These are the points that ‘support’ the margin i.e. define it (as opposed to a weighted average of all points for instance.)

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks!

Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Raghav says: November 10, 2016 at 8:09 pm All programe has error named Error in model.frame.default(formula = as.list(y_train) ~ ., data = x, : invalid type (list) for variable ‘as.list(y_train)’ What is that ? Gaurav says: December 8, 2016 at 1:54 pm I think that “y_train” is data frame and it cannot be converted directly to list with “as.list” command. Try this instead y_train <- as.list(as.data.frame(t(y_train))) See if this works for you. Suman says: December 9, 2016 at 6:43 am Very nice summary!

Can anyone help me to run the codes in R what should be replaced with “~” symbol in codes? Help is appreciated . AshuthoshGowda says: October 29, 2016 at 12:06 am “~” is used to select the variables that you’ll be using for a particular model. “label~.,” – Uses all your Attributes “label~Att1 + Att2,” – Uses only Att1 and Att2 to create the model Sudipta Basak says: August 12, 2015 at 3:35 am Enjoyed the simplicity. Thanks for the effort. Im_utm says: August 12, 2015 at 2:37 pm Great Article… Helps a lot, as naive in Machine Learning. Sunil Ray says: August 14, 2015 at 7:36 am Hi All, Thanks for the comment … Dalila says: August 14, 2015 at 1:35 pm Very good summary. Thank! One simple point. The reason for taking the log(p/(1-p)) in Logistic Regression is to make the equation linear, I.e., easy to solve. Sunil Ray says: August 21, 2015 at 5:21 am Thanks Dalila… 🙂 Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:48 am That’s not the reason for taking the log. The underlying assumption in logistic regression is that the probability is governed by a step function whose argument is linear in the attributes. First of all the assumption of linearity or otherwise introduces bias. However, logistic regression being a parametric model some bias is inevitable. The reason to choose a linear relationship is not because its easy to solve but because a higher order polynomial introduces higher bias and one would not like to do so without good reason. Now coming to the choice of log, it is just a convention. Basically, once we have decided to go with a linear model, in the case of one attribute we model the probability by p(x) = f( ax+b) such that p(-infinity)=0 and p(infinity)=0. It so happens that this is satisfied by p(x) = exp(ax+b)/ (1 + exp(ax+b)) which can be re-written as log(p(x)/(1-p(x)) = a x+ b While I am at it, it may be useful to talk about another point. One should ask is why we don’t use least square method. The reason is that a yes/no choice is a Bernoulli random variable and thus we estimate the probability according to maximum likelihood wrt Bernoulli process. For linear regression the assumption is that the residuals around the ‘true’ function are distributed according to a normal distribution and the maximum likelihood estimate for a normal distribution amounts to the least square method. So deep down linear regression and logistic regression both use maximum likelihood estimates. Its just that they are max likelihoods according to different distributions. Statis says: August 19, 2015 at 12:14 am Nice summary! @Huzefa: you shouldn’t replace the “~” in the R code, it basically means “as a function of”. You can also keep the “.” right after, it stands for “all other variables in the dataset provided”. If you want to be explicit, you can write y ~ x1 + x2 + … where x1, x2 .. are the names of the columns of your data.frame or data.table. Further note on formula specification: by default R adds an intercept, so that y ~ x is equivalent to y ~ 1 + x, you can remove it via y ~ 0 + x. Interactions are specified with either * (which also adds the two variables) or : (which only adds the interaction term). y ~ x1 * x2 is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 : x2. Hope this helps! Chris says: August 26, 2015 at 1:01 am You did a Wonderful job! This is really helpful. Thanks! Glenn Nelson says: September 10, 2015 at 7:48 pm I took the Stanford-Coursera ML class, but have not used it, and I found this to be an incredibly useful summary. I appreciate the real-world analogues, such as your mention of Jezzball. And showing the brief code snips is terrific. Shankar Pandala says: September 15, 2015 at 12:09 pm This is very easy and helpful than any other courses I have completed. simple. clear. To the point. markpratley says: September 26, 2015 at 9:29 am You Sir are a gentleman and a scholar! whystatistics says: September 29, 2015 at 10:25 am Hi Sunil, This is really superb tutorial along with good examples and codes which is surely much helpful. Just, can you add Neural Network here in simple terms with example and code. Sayan Putatunda says: November 1, 2015 at 7:00 am Errata:- fit <- kmeans(X, 3) # 5 cluster solution It`s a 3 cluster solution. Baha says: November 27, 2015 at 1:13 pm Well done, Thank you! Benjamin says: December 5, 2015 at 7:00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work. Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong. It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability. it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression. As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example. I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1. Thanks for the great article overall.

Dan Sulzinger says: March 1, 2016 at 1:21 am Good Article. Pansy says: March 8, 2016 at 3:04 pm I have to thank you for this informative summary. Really useful! J says: March 10, 2016 at 8:54 pm Somewhat irresponsible article since it does not mention any measure of performance and only gives cooking recipes without understanding what algorithm does what and the stats behind it. Cooking recipes like these are the ones that place people in Drew Conway’s danger zone (https://www.quora.com/In-the-data-science-venn-diagram-why-is-the-common-region-of-Hacking-Skills-and-Substantive-Expertise-considered-as-danger-zone), thus making programmers the worst data analysts (let alone scientists, that requires another mindset completely). I highly recommend anyone wishing to enter into this brave new world not to jump into statistical learning without proper statistical background. Otherwise you could end up like Google, Target, Telefonica, or Google (again) and become a poster boy for “The Big Flops of Big Data”. George says: June 17, 2016 at 1:34 pm Do you have a better article?Please share… Robin White says: March 15, 2016 at 11:38 pm Great article. It really summarize some of the most important topics on machine learning. But as asked above I would like to present thedevmasters.com as a company with a really good course to learn more depth about machine learning with great professors and a sense of community that is always helping itself to continue learning even after the course ends. salman ahmed says: March 19, 2016 at 8:29 am awesome , recommended this article to all my friends Borun Chowdhury says: April 21, 2016 at 8:13 am Very succinct description of some important algorithms. Thanks. I’d like to point out a mistake in the SVM section. You say “where each point has two co-ordinates (these co-ordinates are known as Support Vectors)”. This is not correct, the coordinates are just features. Its the points lying on the margin that are called the ‘support vectors’. These are the points that ‘support’ the margin i.e. define it (as opposed to a weighted average of all points for instance.) Isaac says: May 24, 2016 at 2:29 am Thank you for this wonderful article…it’s proven helpful. Payal gour says: June 11, 2016 at 5:52 am Thank you very much, A Very useful and excellent compilation. nd says: June 17, 2016 at 7:39 am Very good information interms of initial knowledge Note one warning, many methods can be fitted into a particular problem, but result might not be what you wish. Hence you must always compare models, understand residuals profile and how prediction really predicts. In that sense, analysis of data is never ending. In R, use summary, plot and check for assumptions validity . Dung Dinh says: June 17, 2016 at 10:24 am The amazing article. I’m new in data analysis. It’s very useful and easy to understand.

Common terms:
Machine learning algorithms can be divided into 3 broad categories — supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.Supervised learning is useful in cases where a property (label) is available for a certain dataset (training set), but is missing and needs to be predicted for other instances. Unsupervised learning is useful in cases where the challenge is to discover implicit relationships in a given unlabeled dataset (items are not pre-assigned). Reinforcement learning falls between these 2 extremes — there is some form of feedback available for each predictive step or action, but no precise label or error message. Since this is an intro class, I didn’t learn about reinforcement learning, but I hope that 10 algorithms on supervised and unsupervised learning will be enough to keep you interested.

In the data science course that I instruct, we cover most of the data science pipeline but focus especially on machine learning. Besides teaching model evaluation procedures and metrics, we obviously teach the algorithms themselves, primarily for supervised learning.
