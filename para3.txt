A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. The relational database was invented by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970.

A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories. Each table (which is sometimes called a relation) contains one or more data categories in columns. Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns. For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth. Another table would describe an order: product, customer, date, sales price, and so forth. A user of the database could obtain a view of the database that fitted the user's needs. For example, a branch office manager might like a view or report on all customers that had bought products after a certain date. A financial services manager in the same company could, from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that needed to be paid.

The relational data model describes the world as “a collection of inter-related relations (or tables) “

The principal storage units are called columns, or fields, or attributes. These will house the basic components of data that your content can be broken down into. When deciding which fields to create you need to think generically about your information.  For example, drawing out the common components of the information that you will store in the database, and avoiding the specifics that distinguish one item from another.

The most common relational model is one where a single record in the parenttable relates to multiple records in the child table. This is called aone-to-many relationship. The sales leads example is a one-to-manyrelationship because one record in the Companies table can relate to manyrecords in the Contacts table (in other words, you can have multiple salescontacts from the same firm). In these models, the "many" table is theone where you add the foreign key.

Another example of a one-to-many relationship is an application that tracksaccounts- receivable invoices. You need one table for the invoice data(Invoices) and another for the customer data (Customers). In this case, onecustomer can place many orders, so Customers is the parent table, Invoices isthe child table, and the common field is the Customer table's primarykey.
