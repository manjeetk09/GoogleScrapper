In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables. More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.

Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs (also called branches) connected by some points sometimes called "remarkable points". A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x-axis. In each direction, an arc is either unbounded (usually called an infinite arc) or has an end point which is either a singular point (this will be defined below) or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the "complete" curve. This point of view is commonly expressed by calling "points at infinity" of the affine curve the points (in finite number) of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.

There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types. Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs. They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function. The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.

These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves. The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.

Algebra is all about graphing relationships, and the curve is one of the most basic shapes used. Here’s a look at eight of the most frequently used graphs.

The following table lists the names of algebraic curves of a given degree.
Curves that can be given in implicit form as f(x,y)=0, where f is a polynomial, are called algebraic. The degree of f is called the degree or order of the curve. Thus conics (Section 7) are algebraic curves of degree two. Curves of degree three already have a great variety of shapes, and only a few common ones will be given here.

More generally, any curve of degree three with equation (x-x)y=f(x), where f is a polynomial, is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and asymptotic to the line x=x. In addition to the cissoid, the following particular cases are important: The witch of Agnesi has equation xy=a(a-x), with a0, and is characterized by the geometric property shown in Figure 2, right. The same property provides the parametric representation x=a(1+sin 2), y=a tan . Once more, proportional scaling reduces to the case a=1.. The folium of Descartes (Figure 3, left) has equation (x-a)y=-x(x+a), with a0 (reducible to a=1 by proportional scaling). By rotating 135°(right) we get the alternative and more familiar equation x+y=cxy, where c=a. The folium of Descartes is a rational curve, this is, it has a parametric representation by rational functions. In the tilted position such a representation is x=ct/(1+t), y=ct/(1+t) (so that t=y/x).    Figure 3: The folium of Descartes in two positions, and the strophoid.. The strophoid has equation (x-a)y=-x(x+a), with a0 (reducible to a=1 by proportional scaling). It satisfies the property AP=AP'=OA in Figure 3, right; this means that POP' is a right angle. The strophoid has the polar representation r=-a cos 2 sec , and the rational parametric representation x=a(t-1)/(t+1), y=at(t-1)/(t+1) (so that t=y/x)..

More generally, any curve of degree three with equation (x-x)y=f(x), where f is a polynomial, is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and asymptotic to the line x=x. In addition to the cissoid, the following particular cases are important: The witch of Agnesi has equation xy=a(a-x), with a0, and is characterized by the geometric property shown in Figure 2, right. The same property provides the parametric representation x=a(1+sin 2), y=a tan . Once more, proportional scaling reduces to the case a=1.. The folium of Descartes (Figure 3, left) has equation (x-a)y=-x(x+a), with a0 (reducible to a=1 by proportional scaling). By rotating 135°(right) we get the alternative and more familiar equation x+y=cxy, where c=a. The folium of Descartes is a rational curve, this is, it has a parametric representation by rational functions. In the tilted position such a representation is x=ct/(1+t), y=ct/(1+t) (so that t=y/x).    Figure 3: The folium of Descartes in two positions, and the strophoid.. The strophoid has equation (x-a)y=-x(x+a), with a0 (reducible to a=1 by proportional scaling). It satisfies the property AP=AP'=OA in Figure 3, right; this means that POP' is a right angle. The strophoid has the polar representation r=-a cos 2 sec , and the rational parametric representation x=a(t-1)/(t+1), y=at(t-1)/(t+1) (so that t=y/x)..
