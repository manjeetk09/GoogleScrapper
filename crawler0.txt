A current example of navigational structuring can be found in the Document Object Model  often used in web browsers and closely associated with JavaScript.
 The DOM  engine  is essentially a lightweight navigational database.
 The World Wide Web itself and Wikipedia could potentially be considered forms of navigational databases, though they focus on humanreadable text rather than data .
 In contrast, the Linked Data facet of the Semantic Web is specifically concerned with networkscale machinereadable data, and follows precisely the  follow your nose  paradigm implied by the navigational idea.

Every DBMS makes use of one or more data structures to help organize the data being stored by the system.
 The data structure allows the DBMS to use the information stored in the database without damaging the integrity of the data.
 Some of the common examples of information that are stored using this functionality within a DBMS include visual media objects, individual records or profiles, field and definitions, and files.

Database technology and database management systems have continued to exponentially grow in complexity and capability over the past several decades.
 When taking a look at the history of DBMS development over the past several decades, the three types of data model that database technology has progressed through include  navigational, relational , and postrelational.
 The early navigational database models were based on a hierarchical structure and were implemented in a number of IBM products to include the IDMS.
 The relational model was first proposed by Edgar F.
 Codd in 1970 and changed the concept by forcing the database system to search for information based on the content vice following a link to the information.
 This model was the first to use tables that were subdivided by type of entity.
 It would take until the mid1980s for computer hardware to catchup to relational theory to allow relational DBMSs to be deployed alongside a processing application.
 This model also gave rise to the development of standard SQL as the primary database language and has helped influenced developments in newer database models.

Database management system is a computer software component introduced during 1960 s.
 It is used for controlling various databases in the desktop computer or server.
 It was also termed as Navigational Database Management System.
 During 1970 s RDBMS or Relational database management system came into existence.
 We ll see about RDBMS later in this article.
