1;A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs 
1; The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator , a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered, but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate processor
1; Some debuggers offer two modes of operation, full or partial simulation, to limit this impact
1; For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory
1; When the program  traps  or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the location in the original code if it is a source_level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly now seen in integrated development environments
1; If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly

1; If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
1; If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
1; Debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program step by step , stopping at some event or specified instruction by means of a breakpoint, and tracking the values of variables
1; Some debuggers have the ability to modify program state while it is running
1; It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error
1; It often also makes it useful as a general verification tool, fault coverage, and performance analyzer, especially if instruction path lengths are shown
1;Most mainstream debugging engines, such as gdb and dbx, provide console_based command line interfaces
1; Debugger front_ends are popular extensions to debugger engines that provide IDE integration, program animation, and visualization features
1; These debuggers make it possible to step a program s execution backwards in time
1; Various debuggers include this feature
1;NET, and some other languages, but not C  
1; Some are open source  some are proprietary commercial software
1; Some reverse debuggers slow down the target by orders of magnitude, but the best reverse debuggers cause a slowdown of 2  or less
1; Reverse debugging is very useful for certain types of problems, but is still not commonly used yet
1; For example, if the main target program is written in COBOL but calls assembly language subroutines and PL 1 subroutines, the debugger may have to dynamically switch modes to accommodate the changes in language as they occur
1;Most modern microprocessors have at least one of these features in their CPU design to make debugging easier
1; Hardware support for single_stepping a program, such as the trap flag
1; An instruction set that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements makes it easier to write debugger software that runs on the same CPU as the software being debugged  such a CPU can execute the inner loops of the program under test at full speed, and still remain under debugger control

1;The following example uses the 
1;foreach token to search for WORD values of 5a4d
1; For each 5a4d value that is found, the debugger displays 8 DWORD values, starting 4 bytes prior to the address where the 5a4d DWORD was found
1;Note If you want to operate on the variable name in the OutCommands portion of the command, you must add a space after the variable name
1;Note If you want to operate on the variable name in the OutCommands portion of the command, you must add a space after the variable name
1; For example, in the preceeding example, there is a space between the variable place and the subtraction operator

1;The _ option together with the s command causes its output to include only the addresses it finds, not the values that are found at those addresses
1;The 1m option together with the lm command causes its output to include only the addresses of the modules, not the full description of the modules
1;The preceding example uses the      token to make sure aliases are replaced even if they are next to other text
1; Note that the     token works on the variables that are used in 
1; Note that the     token works on the variables that are used in 
1;foreach and on true aliases
1; This command loads the whole file, replaces all carriage returns with semicolons, and executes the resulting block
1; This command enables you to write readable programs by using multiple lines and indentation, instead of having to squeeze the whole program onto a single line
1;This example illustrates the following features
1; The  t0,  t1, and  t2 pseudo_registers are used as variables in this program
1; The program also uses aliases named Procc and  ImageName
1; This program uses the MASM expression evaluator
1; This token causes the program to use the C   expression evaluator to parse the expression within the parentheses
1; This usage enables the program to use the C   structure tokens directly

1; Debugging is part of the software testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle
1; Debugging is part of the software testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle
1; The debugging process starts as soon as code is written and continues in successive stages as code is combined with other units of programming to form a software product
1; In a large program that has thousands and thousands of lines of code, the debugging process can be made easier by using strategies such as unit tests, code reviews and pair programming

1;Once an error has been identified, it is necessary to actually find the error in the code
1; At this point, it can be useful to look at the code s logging and use a stand_alone debugger tool or the debugging component of an integrated development environment 
1; Invariably, the bugs in the functions that get most use are found and fixed first
1; In some cases, the module that presents the problem is obvious, while the line of code itself is not
1; In that case, unit tests __ such as JUnit and xUnit, which allow the programmer to run a specific function with specific inputs __ can be helpful in debugging

1;The standard practice is to set up a  breakpoint  and run the program until that breakpoint, at which time program execution stops
1;The standard practice is to set up a  breakpoint  and run the program until that breakpoint, at which time program execution stops
1; The debugging component of an IDE typically provides the programmer with the capability to view memory and see variables, run the program to the next breakpoint, execute just the next line of code, and, in some cases, change the value of variables or even change the contents of the line of code about to be executed
1;Source code analyzers, which include security, common code errors and complexity analyzers, can also be helpful in debugging
1; A complexity analyzer can find modules that are so intricate as to be hard to understand and test
1; Other debugging tools include advanced logging and simulators that allow the programmer to model how an app on a mobile device will display and behave
1;Some tools, especially open source tools and scripting languages, do not run in an IDE and require a more manual approach to debugging
1;The use of the word bug as a synonym for error originated in engineering

1;This example shows how to debug a DATA step when output is missing
1;This program creates information about a travel tour group
1; The data files contain two types of records
1; One type contains the tour code, and the other type contains customer information
1; One type contains the tour code, and the other type contains customer information
1; One type contains the tour code, and the other type contains customer information
1; One type contains the tour code, and the other type contains customer information
1; The program creates a report listing tour number, name, age, and sex for each customer
1;The program executes without error, but the output is unexpected
1; The output does not contain values for the variable Tour
1; Viewing the SAS log will not help you debug the program because the data are valid and no errors appear in the log
1; Viewing the SAS log will not help you debug the program because the data are valid and no errors appear in the log
1; Viewing the SAS log will not help you debug the program because the data are valid and no errors appear in the log
1; To help identify the logic error, run the DATA step again using the DATA step debugger
1;The following display shows the resulting two debugger windows
1;The upper window is the DEBUGGER LOG window
1; Issue debugger commands in this window by typing commands on the debugger command line 
1; The debugger displays the command and results in the upper part of the window
1;The lower window is the DEBUGGER SOURCE window
1; Each line in the DATA step is numbered with the same line number used in the SAS log
1; This means that SAS has compiled the step and will begin to execute the step at the top of the DATA step loop
1;To debug a DATA step, create a hypothesis about the logic error and test it by examining the values of variables at various points in the program
1;Note
1;   Most debugger commands have abbreviations, and you can assign commands to function keys

1;   When you press ENTER, the following display appears
1;The values of all variables appear in the DEBUGGER LOG window
1; SAS has compiled, but not yet executed, the INPUT statement
1;Use the STEP command to execute the DATA step statements one at a time
1; By default, the STEP command is assigned to the ENTER key
1;Because Tour information was missing in the program output, enter the EXAMINE command to view the value of the variable Tour for the first iteration of the DATA step
1;The following display shows the results
1;The variable Tour contains the value Tour 101, showing you that Tour was read
1; The first iteration of the DATA step worked as intended
1; Press ENTER to reach the top of the DATA step
1;You can use the BREAK command to suspend DATA step execution at a particular line you designate
1;Execute the GO command to continue DATA step execution until it reaches the breakpoint 
1;Execute the GO command to continue DATA step execution until it reaches the breakpoint 
1;The following display shows the result
1; Examine the values of all the variables to see their status at this point
1;The following display shows the values
1; The program data vector gets reset to missing values at the beginning of each iteration and therefore does not retain the value of Tour
1;To end the debugging session, issue the QUIT command on the debugger command line
1;The debugging windows disappear, and the original SAS session resumes
1;Correct the original program by adding the RETAIN statement
1; Delete the DEBUG option from the DATA step, and resubmit the program
1;This example shows how to debug a program when you use format statements to format dates
1; The following program creates a report that lists travel tour dates for specific countries
1; The following program creates a report that lists travel tour dates for specific countries
1;The value of Duration for the tour to Venezuela shows a negative number, _290 days
1; To help identify the error, run the DATA step again using the DATA step debugger
1;At the DEBUGGER LOG command line, issue the EXAMINE command to display the values of all variables in the program data vector before execution begins
1;Initial values of all variables appear in the DEBUGGER LOG window
1;Press ENTER to issue the STEP command
1; SAS executes the INPUT statement, and the assignment statement is now highlighted
1;Issue the EXAMINE command to display the current value of all variables
1;The following display shows the results
1;Because a problem exists with the Venezuela tour, suspend execution before the assignment statement when the value of Country equals Venezuela
1; Set a breakpoint to do this
1;Execute the GO command to resume program execution
1;SAS stops execution when the country name is Venezuela
1;SAS stops execution when the country name is Venezuela
1; You can examine Start and End tour dates for the Venezuela trip
1; Because the assignment statement is highlighted , there will be no value for Duration
1;The following display shows the results
1;To view formatted SAS dates, issue the EXAMINE command using the DATEw
1; format
1;The following display shows the results
1;Because the tour ends on November 18, 2000, and not on January 18, 2000, there is an error in the variable End

1;You can use a SAS format or a user_created format when you display a value with the EXAMINE command
1; For example, assume the variable BEGIN contains a SAS date value
1; To display the day of the week and date, use the SAS WEEKDATEw
1; format with EXAMINE
1;When the value of BEGIN is 033001, the debugger displays

1;A good debugger is one of the most important tools in a programmer s toolkit
1;A good debugger is one of the most important tools in a programmer s toolkit
1; On a UNIX or Linux system, GDB is a powerful and popular debugging tool  it lets you do whatever you like with your program running under GDB
1;Should you read this  You have a general idea of programming with C or C  
1; You put a lot of cout or printf statements in the code if something goes wrong
1; You put a lot of cout or printf statements in the code if something goes wrong
1; You have used a debugger with an IDE, and are curious about how the command line works
1;Gcc is the de facto compiler in Linux or any other  nix system
1; It also has Windows ports but on Windows, you ll probably find the debugger in Visual Studio  easier 
1;Suppose you have a file called main
1;cpp containing your c   code
1;So the final command turns into
1; If you re wondering what _Wall and _Werror are, you may find this page on GCC a useful read
1; 
1;Don t worry if it looks cumbersome, you ll get used to it   If you ve got multiple source files you should use a good build system like make or Scons
1; 
1;Provided you ve compiled your program with the debugging symbols enabled, you re ready to start debugging
1; Any time there is text you should replace, I ve put it in  angle brackets 
1; The line at which you want the program to temporarily stop is called the breakpoint
1;When the program is stopped, you can do a number of important things, but most importantly you need to see which part of the code you ve stopped
1;When the program is stopped, you can do a number of important things, but most importantly you need to see which part of the code you ve stopped
1; The command for this purpose is  list 
1;Just starting and stopping isn t much of a control
1; GDB also lets you to run the program line_by_line by the commands  next  and  step 
1; GDB also lets you to run the program line_by_line by the commands  next  and  step 
1; There is a little difference between the two, though
1; Next keeps the control strictly in the current scope whereas step follows the execution through function calls
1;Look at this example carefully 
1;Suppose you have a line in the code like
1;Suppose you have a line in the code like
1;If you use the next command, the line gets executed and the control advances to the next line, readinput, where you can perhaps examine  value  to get an idea of how displayworked
1;But if you use the step command, you get to follow what displaydoes directly, and the control advances to the first line of display, wherever it is
1; To examine a variable, just use
1;Note
1;You can modify variables to see if an issue is resolved if the variable has another value or to force the program to follow a particular path to see if the reason for a bug was due to a variable having the wrong value
1;Setting watchpoints is like asking the debugger to provide you with a running commentary of any changes that happen to the variables
1;Setting watchpoints is like asking the debugger to provide you with a running commentary of any changes that happen to the variables
1; Whenever a change occurs, the program pauses and provides you with the details of the change
1;The command to set a simple watchpoint  a write watchpoint, i
1;Note
1; You can only set watchpoints for a variable when it is in scope
1;Now follow the commands and the outputs carefully, especially the watchpoints
1; What I m doing is basically
1; Setting a breakpoint just in the line of the function call
1; Stepping into the function from that line
1; Setting watchpoints for both the result of the calculation and the input number as it changes
1;You have now seen enough to try GBD out on your own
1; Some important topics have not been touched upon here for the sake of simplicity, such as dealing with segmentation faults and other kinds of crashes or using tools like Valgrind to find memory leaks
1;Remember that GDB comes built in with an excellent help system
1; Just type help in the prompt and you will be presented with options of what you could need help with
1; For details about a specific command, use the syntax
1;After learning about GDB, you do not have to panic the next time your program goes crazy
1; You have an excellent weapon in your arsenal now
