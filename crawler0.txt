Algorithms/Left_rotation: This shows how balancing is applied to establish a priority heap invariant in a Treap, a data structure which has the queueing performance of a heap, and the key lookup performance of a tree.
 A balancing operation can change the tree structure while maintaining another order, which is binary tree sort order.
 The binary tree order is left to right, with left nodes' keys less than right nodes' keys, whereas the priority order is up and down, with higher nodes' priorities greater than lower nodes' priorities.
 Alternatively, the priority can be viewed as another ordering key, except that finding a specific key is more involved.

There is a distinction between a tree as an abstract data type and as a concrete data structure, analogous to the distinction between a list and a linked list.
 As a data type, a tree has a value and children, and the children are themselves trees; the value and children of the tree are interpreted as the value of the root node and the subtrees of the children of the root node.
 To allow finite trees, one must either allow the list of children to be empty , or allow trees to be empty, in which case the list of children can be of fixed size , if desired.

This is a list of data structures.

Some properties of abstract data types:.
A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.
In these data structures each tree node compares a bit slice of key values.
These are data structures used for space partitioning or binary space partitioning.

In a normal tree, every node can have any number of children.
 Binary tree is a special type of tree data structure in which every node can have a maximum of 2 children.
 One is known as left child and the other is known as right child.
In this chapter we will discuss tree data structures, like trees and graphs.
 The abilities of these data structures are really important for the modern programming.
 Each of this data structures is used for building a model of real life problems, which are efficiently solved using this model.
 We will explain what tree data structures are and will review their main advantages and disadvantages.
 We will present example implementations and problems showing their practical usage.
 We will focus on binary trees, binary search trees and self_balancing binary search tree.
 We will explain what graph is, the types of graphs, how to represent a graph in the memory and where graphs are used in our life and in the computer technologies.

The tree is one of the most powerful of the advanced data structures and it often pops up in even more advanced subjects such as AI and compiler design.
 Surprisingly though the tree is important in a much more basic application _ namely the keeping of an efficient index.

Whenever you use a database there is a 99% chance that an index is involved somewhere.
 The simplest type of index is a sorted listing of the key field.
 This provides a fast lookup because you can use a binary search to locate any item without having to look at each one in turn.

Summary: This article, the third in a six_part series on data structures in the .
NET Framework, looks at a common data structure that is not included in the .
NET Framework Base Class Library—binary trees.
 Whereas arrays arrange data linearly, binary trees can be envisioned as storing data in two dimensions.
 A special kind of binary tree, called a binary search tree, or BST, allows for a much more optimized search time than with unsorted arrays.

Now that we have studied linear data structures like stacks and queues and have some experience with recursion, we will look at a common data structure called the tree.
 Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics, database systems, and computer networking.
 Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical cousins.
 A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves.
 The difference between a tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data structure has its root at the top and its leaves on the bottom.
Even though computers can perform literally millions of mathematical computations per second, when a problem gets large and complicated, performance can nonetheless be an important consideration.
 One of the most crucial aspects to how quickly a problem can be solved is how the data is stored in memory.
 To illustrate this point, consider going to the local library to find a book about a specific subject matter.
 Most likely, you will be able to use some kind of electronic reference or, in the worst case, a card catalog, to determine the title and author of the book you want.
 Since the books are typically shelved by category, and within each category sorted by author’s name, it is a fairly straightforward and painless process to then physically select your book from the shelves.
 Now, suppose instead you came to the library in search of a particular book, but instead of organized shelves, were greeted with large garbage bags lining both sides of the room, each arbitrarily filled with books that may or may not have anything to do with one another.
 It would take hours, or even days, to find the book you needed, a comparative eternity.
 This is how software runs when data is not stored in an efficient format appropriate to the application.
 Simple Data Structures The simplest data structures are primitive variables.
 They hold a single value, and beyond that, are of limited use.
 When many related values need to be stored, an array is used.
 It is assumed that the reader of this article has a solid understanding of variables and arrays.
 A somewhat more difficult concept, though equally primitive, are pointers.
 Pointers, instead of holding an actual value, simply hold a memory address that, in theory, contains some useful piece of data.
 Most seasoned C++ coders have a solid understanding of how to use pointers, and many of the caveats, while fledgling programmers may find themselves a bit spoiled by more modern "managed" languages which, for better or worse, handle pointers implicitly.
 Either way, it should suffice to know that pointers "point" somewhere in memory, and do not actually store data themselves.
 A less abstract way to think about pointers is in how the human mind remembers certain things.
 Many times, a good engineer may not necessarily know a particular formula/constant/equation, but when asked, they could tell you exactly which reference to check.
 Arrays Arrays are a very simple data structure, and may be thought of as a list of a fixed length.
 Arrays are nice because of their simplicity, and are well suited for situations where the number of data items is known .
 Suppose you need a piece of code to calculate the average of several numbers.
 An array is a perfect data structure to hold the individual values, since they have no specific order, and the required computations do not require any special handling other than to iterate through all of the values.
 The other big strength of arrays is that they can be accessed randomly, by index.
 For instance, if you have an array containing a list of names of students seated in a classroom, where each seat is numbered 1 through n, then studentName is a trivial way to read or store the name of the student in seat i.
 An array might also be thought of as a pre_bound pad of paper.
 It has a fixed number of pages, each page holds information, and is in a predefined location that never changes.
 Linked Lists A linked list is a data structure that can hold an arbitrary number of data items, and can easily change size to add or remove items.
 A linked list, at its simplest, is a pointer to a data node.
 Each data node is then composed of data , and a pointer to the next node.
 At the end of the list, the pointer is set to null.
 By nature of its design, a linked list is great for storing data when the number of items is either unknown, or subject to change.
 However, it provides no way to access an arbitrary item from the list, short of starting at the beginning and traversing through every node until you reach the one you want.
 The same is true if you want to insert a new node at a specific location.
 It is not difficult to see the problem of inefficiency.
 A typical linked list implementation would have code that defines a node, and looks something like this:.
