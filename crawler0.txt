1;A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs 
1; The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator , a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered, but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate processor
1; Some debuggers offer two modes of operation, full or partial simulation, to limit this impact
1; For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory
1; When the program  traps  or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the location in the original code if it is a source_level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly now seen in integrated development environments
1; If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly

1; If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
1; If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
1; Debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program step by step , stopping at some event or specified instruction by means of a breakpoint, and tracking the values of variables
1; Some debuggers have the ability to modify program state while it is running
1; It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error
1; It often also makes it useful as a general verification tool, fault coverage, and performance analyzer, especially if instruction path lengths are shown
1;Most mainstream debugging engines, such as gdb and dbx, provide console_based command line interfaces
1; Debugger front_ends are popular extensions to debugger engines that provide IDE integration, program animation, and visualization features
1; These debuggers make it possible to step a program s execution backwards in time
1; Various debuggers include this feature
1;NET, and some other languages, but not C  
1; Some are open source  some are proprietary commercial software
1; Some reverse debuggers slow down the target by orders of magnitude, but the best reverse debuggers cause a slowdown of 2  or less
1; Reverse debugging is very useful for certain types of problems, but is still not commonly used yet
1; For example, if the main target program is written in COBOL but calls assembly language subroutines and PL 1 subroutines, the debugger may have to dynamically switch modes to accommodate the changes in language as they occur
1;Most modern microprocessors have at least one of these features in their CPU design to make debugging easier
1; Hardware support for single_stepping a program, such as the trap flag
1; An instruction set that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements makes it easier to write debugger software that runs on the same CPU as the software being debugged  such a CPU can execute the inner loops of the program under test at full speed, and still remain under debugger control

1;The following example uses the 
1;foreach token to search for WORD values of 5a4d
1; For each 5a4d value that is found, the debugger displays 8 DWORD values, starting 4 bytes prior to the address where the 5a4d DWORD was found
1;Note If you want to operate on the variable name in the OutCommands portion of the command, you must add a space after the variable name
1;Note If you want to operate on the variable name in the OutCommands portion of the command, you must add a space after the variable name
1; For example, in the preceeding example, there is a space between the variable place and the subtraction operator
1; For example, in the preceeding example, there is a space between the variable place and the subtraction operator
1;The _ option together with the s command causes its output to include only the addresses it finds, not the values that are found at those addresses
1;The 1m option together with the lm command causes its output to include only the addresses of the modules, not the full description of the modules
1;The preceding example uses the      token to make sure aliases are replaced even if they are next to other text
1; Note that the     token works on the variables that are used in 
1; Note that the     token works on the variables that are used in 
1;foreach and on true aliases
1; This command loads the whole file, replaces all carriage returns with semicolons, and executes the resulting block
1; This command enables you to write readable programs by using multiple lines and indentation, instead of having to squeeze the whole program onto a single line
1;This example illustrates the following features
1; The  t0,  t1, and  t2 pseudo_registers are used as variables in this program
1; The program also uses aliases named Procc and  ImageName
1; This program uses the MASM expression evaluator
1; This token causes the program to use the C   expression evaluator to parse the expression within the parentheses
1; This usage enables the program to use the C   structure tokens directly
1; The   flag is used with the r command

1; This usage enables the program to use C   structure tokens directly
1; The   flag is used with the r command
1; In the body of the loop,  t1 has the type ntdll _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY  , so the program can make direct member references
1; In the body of the loop,  t1 has the type ntdll _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY  , so the program can make direct member references
1; The user_named aliases  Base and  Mod are used in this program
1; The dollar signs reduce the possibility that these aliases have been used previously in the current debugger session
1; The dollar signs are not necessary
1; The    v
1;   token interprets the alias literally, preventing it from being replaced if it was defined before the script is run
1; The 
1;block token is used to add an extra alias replacement step
1; Alias replacement occurs one time for the whole script when it is loaded and one time when each block is entered
1; Without the 
1;block token and its braces, the 
1;echo command does not receive the values of the  Mod and  Base aliases that are assigned in the previous lines

1;Errors can happen, every time you write some new computer code
1;Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose
1;Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen
1; There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors
1; There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors

1; Debugging is part of the software testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle
1; The debugging process starts as soon as code is written and continues in successive stages as code is combined with other units of programming to form a software product
1; In a large program that has thousands and thousands of lines of code, the debugging process can be made easier by using strategies such as unit tests, code reviews and pair programming

1;Once an error has been identified, it is necessary to actually find the error in the code
1; At this point, it can be useful to look at the code s logging and use a stand_alone debugger tool or the debugging component of an integrated development environment 
1; Invariably, the bugs in the functions that get most use are found and fixed first
1; In some cases, the module that presents the problem is obvious, while the line of code itself is not
1; In that case, unit tests __ such as JUnit and xUnit, which allow the programmer to run a specific function with specific inputs __ can be helpful in debugging
1; In that case, unit tests __ such as JUnit and xUnit, which allow the programmer to run a specific function with specific inputs __ can be helpful in debugging
1;The standard practice is to set up a  breakpoint  and run the program until that breakpoint, at which time program execution stops
1;The standard practice is to set up a  breakpoint  and run the program until that breakpoint, at which time program execution stops
1; The debugging component of an IDE typically provides the programmer with the capability to view memory and see variables, run the program to the next breakpoint, execute just the next line of code, and, in some cases, change the value of variables or even change the contents of the line of code about to be executed
1;Source code analyzers, which include security, common code errors and complexity analyzers, can also be helpful in debugging
1; A complexity analyzer can find modules that are so intricate as to be hard to understand and test
1; Other debugging tools include advanced logging and simulators that allow the programmer to model how an app on a mobile device will display and behave
1;Some tools, especially open source tools and scripting languages, do not run in an IDE and require a more manual approach to debugging
1;The use of the word bug as a synonym for error originated in engineering
1; The term s application to computing and the inspiration for using the word debugging as a synonym for troubleshooting has been attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer programming, who was also known for her dry sense of humor
