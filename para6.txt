There are different ways of debugging Toolset plugins, depending on the type of the problem you are facing.
JavaScript debugging is done using the browser’s built-in Developer Tools, more specifically, using a JavaScript Console. Today, all major browsers feature Developer Tools and a JavaScript Console: In Chrome, click the Main menu button->More Tools->Developer Tools. Select the Console tab.. In Firefox, click the Main menu button->Developer->Web Console.. In Internet Explorer, click the Tools button->F12 Developer Tools. Select the Console tab..

The emerging field of "auditory display" uses sound to convey more detailed information. For debugging purposes, this requires translating arbitrary data into sound through a process called "sonification" or "audification." Through this process, a language of sound is created. What does this mean? While generating different notes to indicate that a variable = 5 or 47 may be less useful, consider using two different notes to indicate bidirectional communications between two programs. The rhythm between the notes conveys how often communications occur, and the relative sizes of the payloads of each message. Music and rhythm are innate tools that in this case would allow us to avoid sifting through pages and pages of interprocessor messaging. More detailed examples of "sonic grammar" have been termed "Earcons."

Another use of audio-visual thread debugging appears in "Place phone to the PC, please" by Martin Wehlou. Martin used a different tune for each thread in a multi-threading (multi-tasking) program. If one thread hangs up (stops running), it can be difficult to trace down unless the thread is something obvious like the user display. But if each thread is associated with a tune, listening to the program until a tune disappears is one way to identify a failure.

Classification of different types of test tools according to the test process activities: The tools are grouped by the testing activities or areas that are supported by a set of tools, for example, tools that support management activities, tools to support static testing, etc.

Other example of the probe effect is when a debugging tool tries to find a particular defect. If the code is run with the debugger, then the bug disappears; it only re-appears when the debugger is turned off, hence making it very difficult to find. These are sometimes known as ‘Heizenbugs’ (after Heizenberg’s uncertainty principle).

Once an error has been identified, it is necessary to actually find the error in the code. At this point, it can be useful to look at the code's logging and use a stand-alone debugger tool or the debugging component of an integrated development environment (IDE). Invariably, the bugs in the functions that get most use are found and fixed first. In some cases, the module that presents the problem is obvious, while the line of code itself is not. In that case, unit tests -- such as JUnit and xUnit, which allow the programmer to run a specific function with specific inputs -- can be helpful in debugging.
