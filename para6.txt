It is easy to generate points on the graph. Choose a value for the first coordinate, then evaluate f at that number to find the second coordinate. The following table shows several values for x and the function f evaluated at those numbers.

First we solve the equation for y.
Last we graph our matching x- and y-values and draw a line.
Example
We are going to graph the equation -4x+2y=2.
First we solve the equation for y:


Here is an example of a graph that is not a function.
For example, if you work in a fast food outlet, your pay packet depends on the number of hours you work. Or, the amount of concrete you need to order when constructing a building will depend on the height of the building.

In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation. Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.

The informal definition of an algebraic function provides a number of clues about their properties. To gain an intuitive understanding, it may be helpful to regard algebraic functions as functions which can be formed by the usual algebraic operations: addition, multiplication, division, and taking an nth root. This is something of an oversimplification; because of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, algebraic functions need not be expressible by radicals.

However, not every function has an inverse. For example, y = x2 fails the horizontal line test: it fails to be one-to-one. The inverse is the algebraic "function" x = ± y {\displaystyle x=\pm {\sqrt {y}}} . Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve.
