Practical example of Complete Binary Tree is Binary Heap.
A Perfect Binary Tree of height h (where height is number of nodes on path from root to leaf) has 2h – 1 node.


Tree terminology is not well-standardized and so varies in the literature.



In a normal tree, every node can have any number of children. Binary tree is a special type of tree data structure in which every node can have a maximum of 2 children. One is known as left child and the other is known as right child.

We consider a particular kind of a binary tree called a Binary Search Tree (BST). The basic idea behind this data structure is to have such a storing repository that provides the efficient way of data sorting, searching and retriving.

Types of trees:
Binary: Each node has zero, one, or two children. This assertion makes many tree operations simple and efficient.

A binary tree is an important type of structure which occurs very often. It is characterized by the fact that any node can have at most two branches, i.e.,there is no node with degree greater than two. For binary trees we distinguish between the subtree on the left and on the right, whereas for trees the order of the subtreewas irrelevant. Also a binary tree may have zero nodes. Thus a binary tree is really a different object than a tree.

See complete series on data structures here: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=... In this lesson, we have discussed binary tree in detail. We have talked about different types of binary tree like "complete binary tree", "perfect binary tree" and "balanced binary tree" and their properties. We have also discussed how cost of operations in a tree may depend upon height of the tree and why we want a tree to be dense and its height to be minimum. Finally, we talked about two possible implementations of binary tree - a) using dynamically created nodes and b) using arrays.

Summary: This article, the third in a six-part series on data structures in the .NET Framework, looks at a common data structure that is not included in the .NET Framework Base Class Library: binary trees. Whereas arrays arrange data linearly, binary trees can be envisioned as storing data in two dimensions. A special kind of binary tree, called a binary search tree, or BST, allows for a much more optimized search time than with arrays. (31 printed pages)
