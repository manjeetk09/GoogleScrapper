In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
 Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.

since the fi are by definition the distinct zeros of p.
 The monodromy group acts by permuting the factors, and thus forms the monodromy representation of the Galois group of p.
  The monodromy action on the universal covering space is related but different notion in the theory of Riemann surfaces.

Algebraic functions are functions that can be expressed as the solution of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients.
 Polynomials.
 Can be generated by addition, multiplication, and exponentiation alone.

There are various types of algebraic functions.
There are many different types of algebraic functions.
 linear, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, rational, and radical equations.
 In this next part of the lesson, we ll learn about a couple of different methods we can use to identify them.
