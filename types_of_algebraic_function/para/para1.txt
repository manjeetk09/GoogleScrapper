There are various types of algebraic functions:
The mathematical concept of a function expresses the intuitive idea that one quantity completely determines another quantity. An equation will be a function if for any x in the domain of the equation, there is exactly one value of y. More formally, a function is defined a type of relation which has only one output value with respect any permissible input value. The argument and the value may be real numbers, but they can also be elements from any given sets: the domain, the co-domain of the function and all the assigned values are in the Range of the function. It is important how we assign the values to each element of the domain. There may be different types of functions in mathematics. The classification of functions on the basis of properties may be as follows : (1) Even Function (2) Odd Function (3) Monotonic Function (4) Surjective Function (5) Bijective Function (6) Injective Function The functions can be classified into following on the basis of variables used : (1) Algebraic Function (2) Exponential Function (3) Logarithmic Function (4) Analytic Function (5) Inverse Function (6) Monotonic Function (7) Polynomial Function (8) Linear Function (9) Quadratic Function (10) Elliptic Function (12) Identity Function (13) Constant Function (14) Power Function (15) Vector-valued Function (16) Integer-valued Function (17) Periodic Function (18) Piece-wise linear Function etc. In this article, we shall learn about few of the above mentioned types of functions.

There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types. Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs. They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function. The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.

Linear graphs are produced by linear functions of this form:
Linear functions have variables to the first degree and have two constants that determine the location of the graph. These functions always graph into a line. The constant m determines whether the line slopes down or up. If it is positive, the line will slope up, and if it is negative, then the line will slope down.

Linear functions have variables to the first degree and have two constants that determine the location of the graph. These functions always graph into a line. The constant m determines whether the line slopes down or up. If it is positive, the line will slope up, and if it is negative, then the line will slope down.

Power graphs are produced by functions with only one term and a power. The power can be positive, negative, or even a fraction.
Power graphs are produced by functions with only one term and a power. The power can be positive, negative, or even a fraction.
The graphs that these types of functions produce vary depending on the power. If the power is positive, the graph changes direction based on the number of the power. If the power is even, the graph will have both edges going in the same direction. If the power is odd, the graph will have one edge going up and another going down. If the power is negative, it will have two parts. Each part will avoid the x=0 line because that will cause division by zero. When the power is a fraction, the graph goes up at x=0 and then when y is positive, it starts curving towards the x-axis.

Quadratics are functions where the highest power is two.
They graph into parabolas. The constants a, b, and c determine the location of the parabola on the graph. The a tells you whether the parabola will open up or down. If it's positive, it will open up and smile. If it's negative, it will open down and frown.

Polynomials are a more general function than a quadratic and allow for higher powers that are still whole numbers.
These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves. The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.

Rational graphs are from functions that are the division of two polynomials. When these are graphed, you will see the graph split into parts. The areas that the graph avoids are where division by zero happens.

When b is greater than one, then you will see exponential growth occur. If it is less than one but greater than zero, you will see exponential decay. Growth is when the graph rises to the right. Decay is when it drops to the right.

Logarithmic functions involve the graphing of logarithms.
These graphs are similar to the exponentials except they rise earlier and grow slower.
Sinusoidal graphs use functions that have the sine function inside.
The graph shows up as a wave pattern.
Different types of graphs depend on the type of function that is graphed. The eight most commonly used graphs are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal. Each has a unique graph that is easy to visually differentiate from the rest.

You might see other types of graphs that aren't listed here. That's because there are many different types of functions, and the more you continue learning math, the more you will get exposed to. What you have learned in this lesson is a good beginning framework for the types of graphs you will see.
