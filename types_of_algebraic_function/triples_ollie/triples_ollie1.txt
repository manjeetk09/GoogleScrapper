There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
No extractions found.

 Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0.564: (the graphs; be produces by; its own type of function)

 They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0.796: (you; can get; an idea what a graph might look like)

 The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
No extractions found.

Linear graphs are produced by linear functions of this form.
0.937: (Linear graphs; are produced by; linear functions of this form)

Linear functions have variables to the first degree and have two constants that determine the location of the graph.
0.833: (Linear functions; have; two constants that determine the location of the graph)
0.784: (Linear functions; have variables to; the first degree)
0.783: (Linear functions; have; variables)

 These functions always graph into a line.
0.842: (These functions; always graph into; a line)

 The constant m determines whether the line slopes down or up.
No extractions found.

 If it is positive, the line will slope up, and if it is negative, then the line will slope down.
0.06: (it; is; positive)

Power graphs are produced by functions with only one term and a power.
0.929: (Power graphs; are produced by; functions)
0.892: (Power graphs; are produced with; only one term and a power)

 The power can be positive, negative, or even a fraction.
0.762: (The power; can be; positive , negative , or even a fraction)

The graphs that these types of functions produce vary depending on the power.
No extractions found.

 If the power is positive, the graph changes direction based on the number of the power.
0.842: (the graph changes direction; be based on; the number of the power)
0.093: (the power; is; positive)

 If the power is even, the graph will have both edges going in the same direction.
0.845: (the graph; will have; both edges going in the same direction)[enabler=If the power is even]
0.729: (both edges; going in; the same direction)

 If the power is odd, the graph will have one edge going up and another going down.
0.091: (the power; is; odd)

 If the power is negative, it will have two parts.
0.678: (it; will have; two parts)[enabler=If the power is negative]
0.093: (the power; is; negative)

 Each part will avoid the x 0 line because that will cause division by zero.
0.808: (Each part; will avoid; the x 0 line)[enabler=because that will cause division by zero]
0.708: (division; will be cause by; zero)

 When the power is a fraction, the graph goes up at x 0 and then when y is positive, it starts curving towards the x_axis.
0.698: (a fraction; goes up then at; x 0)[enabler=when y is positive]
0.698: (the graph; goes up then at; x 0)[enabler=when y is positive]
0.67: (it; starts curving towards; the x_axis)
0.653: (the power; is; a fraction)
0.457: (y; is; positive)

Quadratics are functions where the highest power is two.
0.7: (the highest power; is; two)

They graph into parabolas.
0.82: (They; be graph into; parabolas)

 The constants a, b, and c determine the location of the parabola on the graph.
0.842: (The constants; determine; the location of the parabola)
0.691: (b , and c; determine; the location of the parabola)

 The a tells you whether the parabola will open up or down.

Polynomials are a more general function than a quadratic and allow for higher powers that are still whole numbers.
0.896: (Polynomials; are a more general function than; a quadratic)
0.853: (Polynomials; allow for; higher powers that are still whole numbers)

These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves.
0.821: (These functions; produce more interesting graphs with; more curves)
0.793: (These functions; produce; interesting graphs)

 The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.
0.618: (The highest power of the function; tells; you)

Rational graphs are from functions that are the division of two polynomials.
0.88: (Rational graphs; are from; functions that are the division of two polynomials)
0.778: (functions; are the division of; two polynomials)

 When these are graphed, you will see the graph split into parts.
0.846: (you; will see; the graph split)
0.648: (you; be the graph split into; parts)

 The areas that the graph avoids are where division by zero happens.
0.732: (the graph avoids; are division by; zero)

Exponentials are where the x variable is the power.
0.632: (Exponentials; are is; the power)
