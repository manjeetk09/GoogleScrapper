In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
0.741: (an algebraic function; is; a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation)
0.688: (an algebraic function; is a function in; mathematics)

 Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.
