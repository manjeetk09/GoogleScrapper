0;In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
0; Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.

0;since the fi are by definition the distinct zeros of p.
0; The monodromy group acts by permuting the factors, and thus forms the monodromy representation of the Galois group of p.
0;  The monodromy action on the universal covering space is related but different notion in the theory of Riemann surfaces.
