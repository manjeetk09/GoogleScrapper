mlpack is a C   machine learning library with emphasis on scalability, speed, and ease_of_use.
 Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C   language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users.
 This is done by providing a set of command_line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C   API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.
As a result of this approach, mlpack outperforms competing machine learning libraries by large margins  see the BigLearning workshop paper and the benchmarks for details.

These are a list of ideas compiled by mlpack developers  they range from simpler code maintenance tasks to difficult machine learning algorithm implementation, which means that there are suitable ideas for a wide range of student abilities and interests.
 The  necessary knowledge  sections can often be replaced with  willing to learn  for the easier projects, and for some of the more difficult problems, a full understanding of the description statement and some coding knowledge is sufficient.
This last goal is somewhat in contrast to the scikit_learn project, which generally only implements stable, well_known algorithms.
 mlpack can fill a niche by providing high_quality implementations of algorithms that just appeared in conferences or journals.
 In those cases where mlpack is implementing well_known algorithms  i.
e.
 SVMs or other standard techniques , we should strive to ensure that our implementation is faster than other implementations.
 To ensure that, we may use the automatic benchmarking system  see https.
