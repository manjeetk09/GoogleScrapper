Many Eclipse perspectives, e.g. the Java Development Tools (JDT), provide a debugger front-end. Allinea DDT - a graphical debugger supporting for parallel/multi-process and multithreaded applications, for C++/C++ and F90. DDD is the standard front-end from the GNU Project. It is a complex tool that works with most common debuggers (GDB, jdb, Python debugger, Perl debugger, Tcl, and others) natively or with some external programs (for PHP). GDB (the GNU debugger) GUI Emacs — Emacs editor with built-in support for the GNU Debugger acts as the frontend. KDbg — Part of the KDE development tools. Nemiver — A GDB frontend that integrates well in the GNOME desktop environment. xxgdb — X-window frontend for GDB and dbx debugger. Qt Creator — multi-platform frontend for GDB, CDB and LLDB. Allinea's DDT — a parallel and distributed front-end to a modified version of GDB. Xcode — contains a GDB front-end as well. SlickEdit — contains a GDB front-end as well. Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools (CDT) — includes visual debugging tools based on GDB. CodeLite — An open source, cross platform C/C++ IDE which have front end for gdb, the next version of CodeLite (v6.0) will also include a front end to the LLDB (debugger) CodeBlocks — A free cross-platform C, C++ and Fortran IDE with a front end for gdb. RR — An open source C/C++ debugger by Mozilla, supporting reproduction of program state and reverse execution

The emerging field of "auditory display" uses sound to convey more detailed information. For debugging purposes, this requires translating arbitrary data into sound through a process called "sonification" or "audification." Through this process, a language of sound is created. What does this mean? While generating different notes to indicate that a variable = 5 or 47 may be less useful, consider using two different notes to indicate bidirectional communications between two programs. The rhythm between the notes conveys how often communications occur, and the relative sizes of the payloads of each message. Music and rhythm are innate tools that in this case would allow us to avoid sifting through pages and pages of interprocessor messaging. More detailed examples of "sonic grammar" have been termed "Earcons."

Classification of different types of test tools according to the test process activities: The tools are grouped by the testing activities or areas that are supported by a set of tools, for example, tools that support management activities, tools to support static testing, etc.

Other example of the probe effect is when a debugging tool tries to find a particular defect. If the code is run with the debugger, then the bug disappears; it only re-appears when the debugger is turned off, hence making it very difficult to find. These are sometimes known as ‘Heizenbugs’ (after Heizenberg’s uncertainty principle).
