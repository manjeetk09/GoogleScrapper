0;In certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful.
0; These take the form of static code analysis tools.
0; These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code.
0; All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers.
0; Some tools claim to be able to detect 300  unique problems.
0; Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages.
0; These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs.
0; A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs before the variable is assigned a value.
0; Another example would be to perform strong type checking when the language does not require such.
0; Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors.
0; As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives.
0; The old Unix lint program is an early example.
