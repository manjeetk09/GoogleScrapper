0;Many Eclipse perspectives, e g  the Java Development Tools , 1  provide a debugger front_end .

0;DDD is the standard front_end from the GNU Project  It is a complex tool that works with most common debuggers natively or with some external programs  .

0;The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running Linux kernel on the source level with gdb.
0; With KGDB, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs.
0; It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code and observe variables.
0; On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed.
0; KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a serial cable or Ethernet.
0; On FreeBSD, it is also possible to debug using Firewire direct memory access .
