Using print statements for debugging a program is often not adequate or convenient.
No extractions found.

 For example, the programmer may want to change the values of certain variables after observing the execution of the program till some point.
0.846: (the programmer; may want to change; the values of certain variables)
0.83: (the programmer; to change; the values of certain variables)
0.674: (the execution of the program; be observing till; some point)
0.287: (the programmer; may want for; example)

 For a large program it may be difficult to go back to the source program, make the necessary changes and rerun the program.
0.734: (it; may be; difficult)
0.513: (it; may be difficult for; a large program)
0.419: (it; may rerun; the program)
0.343: (it; may make; the necessary changes)

 Again, if such print statements are placed inside loops, it will produce output everytime the loop is executed though the programmer may be interested in only certain iterations of the loop.
0.903: (the programmer; may be interested in; certain iterations of the loop)
0.398: (it; Again will produce; output)
0.315: (such print statements; are placed inside; loops)

 To overcome several such drawbacks of debugging by inserting extra statements in the program, there are a kind of tool called debugger that helps in debugging programs by giving the programmer some control over the execution of the program and some means of examining and modifying different program variables during runtime.
0.84: (a kind of tool called debugger; helps in; debugging programs)
0.674: (different program variables; be examining during; runtime)
0.622: (extra statements; be inserting in; the program)

Fortunately, there are programs called debuggers that help software developers find and eliminate bugs while they are writing programs.
0.689: (help software developers; eliminate; bugs)
0.612: (they; are writing; programs)

 A debugger tells the programmer what types of errors it finds and often marks the exact lines of code where the bugs are found.
0.735: (A debugger; tells; the programmer what types of errors it finds and often marks the exact lines of code)
0.727: (it; finds of; code where the bugs are found)
0.647: (it; finds; the exact lines of code)
0.576: (the exact lines of code; be finds by; the programmer what types of errors it finds and often marks)
0.564: (the bugs; are found in; code)

 Debuggers also allow programmers to run a program step by step so that they can determine exactly when and why a program crashes.
0.747: (programmers; to run; a program step)
0.745: (programmers; to run a program step by; step)
0.585: (a program step; to be run by; step)

 Advanced debuggers provide detailed information about threads and memory being used by the program during each step of execution.
0.785: (Advanced debuggers; provide detailed; information)
0.679: (threads and memory; being used by; the program)
0.663: (threads and memory; being used during; each step of execution)

 You could say a powerful debugger program is like OFF  with 100  deet.
