In certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful.

0.731: (general purpose software tools; are language specific in; nature)
0.572: (general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature; can be very useful in; certain situations)

 These take the form of static code analysis tools.
No extractions found.

 These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code.
0.861: (These tools; look for; a very specific set of known problems)
0.595: (specific; set of known problems within; the source code)
0.4: (specific; set of; known problems)

 All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers.
0.828: (All such issues detected by these tools; would rarely be picked up thus by; a compiler or interpreter)
0.707: (All such issues; be detected by; these tools)

 Some tools claim to be able to detect 300  unique problems.

 Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages.

 These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs.
0.717: (These tools; can be extremely; useful)
0.563: (it; is; impractical)

 A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs before the variable is assigned a value.
0.779: (A typical example of a problem; would be; a variable dereference that occurs before the variable)
0.728: (a variable dereference; occurs before; the variable)
0.695: (a variable dereference that occurs before the variable; is assigned; a value)
0.405: (a variable dereference that occurs before the variable; be A typical example of; a problem detected)

 Another example would be to perform strong type checking when the language does not require such.

 Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors.

 As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives.
