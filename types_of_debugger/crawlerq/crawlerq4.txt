Some widely used debuggers are.
 Firefox JavaScript debugger.
 GDB _ the GNU debugger.
 LLDB.
 Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger.
 Valgrind.
 WinDbg.
 Eclipse debugger API used in a range of IDEs.
 Eclipse IDE Nodeclipse .
 WDW, the OpenWatcom debugger.
.
.
These two types of debugging provide you with some very technical information.
 You can use it to do an online search for a possible solution or cause to the problem, or to provide additional information to our Customer Support when opening a ticket.
JavaScript debugging is done using the browser s built_in Developer Tools, more specifically, using a JavaScript Console.
 Today, all major browsers feature Developer Tools and a JavaScript Console.
 In Chrome, click the Main menu button_ More Tools_ Developer Tools.
 Select the Console tab.
 In Firefox, click the Main menu button_ Developer_ Web Console.
 In Internet Explorer, click the Tools button_ F12 Developer Tools.
 Select the Console tab.
 In Edge, click the More button_ F12 Developer Tools.
 Select the Console tab.

Many Eclipse perspectives, e g  the Java Development Tools , 1  provide a debugger front_end .
Allinea DDT _ a graphical debugger supporting for parallel multi_process and multithreaded applications, for C   C   and F90 .
DDD is the standard front_end from the GNU Project  It is a complex tool that works with most common debuggers natively or with some external programs  .
GDB GUI Emacs   Emacs editor with built_in support for the GNU Debugger acts as the frontend  KDbg   Part of the KDE development tools  Nemiver   A GDB frontend that integrates well in the GNOME desktop environment  xxgdb   X_window frontend for GDB and dbx debugger  Qt Creator   multi_platform frontend for GDB, CDB and LLDB  Allinea s DDT   a parallel and distributed front_end to a modified version of GDB  Xcode   contains a GDB front_end as well  SlickEdit   contains a GDB front_end as well  Eclipse C C   Development Tools  2    includes visual debugging tools based on GDB  CodeLite   An open source, cross platform C C   IDE which have front end for gdb, the next version of CodeLite will also include a front end to the LLDB CodeBlocks   A free cross_platform C, C   and Fortran IDE with a front end for gdb  RR   An open source C C   debugger by Mozilla, supporting reproduction of program state and reverse execution.

The emerging field of  auditory display  uses sound to convey more detailed information.
 For debugging purposes, this requires translating arbitrary data into sound through a process called  sonification  or  audification.
  Through this process, a language of sound is created.
 What does this mean  While generating different notes to indicate that a variable   5 or 47 may be less useful, consider using two different notes to indicate bidirectional communications between two programs.
 The rhythm between the notes conveys how often communications occur, and the relative sizes of the payloads of each message.
 Music and rhythm are innate tools that in this case would allow us to avoid sifting through pages and pages of interprocessor messaging.
 More detailed examples of  sonic grammar  have been termed  Earcons.

Classification of different types of test tools according to the test process activities.
 The tools are grouped by the testing activities or areas that are supported by a set of tools, for example, tools that support management activities, tools to support static testing, etc.
Other example of the probe effect is when a debugging tool tries to find a particular defect.
 If the code is run with the debugger, then the bug disappears  it only re_appears when the debugger is turned off, hence making it very difficult to find.
 These are sometimes known as  Heizenbugs  .
Tools for Debugging.
 Each of the above debugging approaches can be supplemented with debugging tools.
 For debugging we can apply wide variety of debugging tools such as debugging compilers, dynamic debugging aids, automatic test case generators, memory dumps and cross reference maps.
 The following are the main Debugging tools available in the market.
 The following information is based upon details from respective web_sites of the tool vendors.
