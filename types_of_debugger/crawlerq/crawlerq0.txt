Some widely used debuggers are.
 Firefox JavaScript debugger.
 GDB _ the GNU debugger.
 LLDB.
 Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger.
 Valgrind.
 WinDbg.
 Eclipse debugger API used in a range of IDEs.
 Eclipse IDE Nodeclipse .
 WDW, the OpenWatcom debugger.
.
.
These two types of debugging provide you with some very technical information.
 You can use it to do an online search for a possible solution or cause to the problem, or to provide additional information to our Customer Support when opening a ticket.

In certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful.
 These take the form of static code analysis tools.
 These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code.
 All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers.
 Some tools claim to be able to detect 300  unique problems.
 Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages.
 These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs.
 A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs before the variable is assigned a value.
 Another example would be to perform strong type checking when the language does not require such.
 Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors.
 As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives.
 The old Unix lint program is an early example.
