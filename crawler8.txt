Strictly, a flat file database should consist of nothing but data and, if records vary in length, delimiters.
 More broadly, the term refers to any database which exists in a single file in the form of rows and columns, with no relationships or links between records and fields except the table structure.

The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing manytomany relationships in a treelike structure that allows multiple parents.
 It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification.

A set consists of circular linked lists where one record type, the set owner or parent, appears once in each circle, and a second record type, the subordinate or child, may appear multiple times in each circle.
 In this way a hierarchy may be established between any two record types, e.
g.
, type A is the owner of B.
 At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A.
 Thus all the sets comprise a general directed graph , or network construct.
 Access to records is either sequential  or by navigation in the circular linked lists.

A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas.
 The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file.
 Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships.
 However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database.
 Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flatfile databases.

Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a nonrelational database.
 A good example of a flat file is a single textonly file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter.
