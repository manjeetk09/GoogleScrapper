0;A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas.
0; The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file.
0; Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships.
0; However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database.
0; Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flat_file databases.

0;The flat model is the earliest, simplest data model.
0; It simply lists all the data in a single table, consisting of columns and rows.
0; In order to access or manipulate the data, the computer has to read the entire flat file into memory, which makes this model inefficient for all but the smallest data sets.

0;Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a non_relational database.
0; A good example of a flat file is a single text_only file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter.

0;A flat file database is a database designed around a single table.
0; The flat file design puts all database information in one table, or list, with fields to represent all parameters.
0; A flat file may contain many fields, often, with duplicate data that are prone to data corruption.
0; If you decide to merge data between two flat files, you need to copy and paste relevant information from one file to the other.
0; There is no automation between flat files.
0; If you have two or more flat files that contain client addresses, for example, and a client moved, you would have to manually modify the address parameters in each file that contains that client s information.
0; Changing information in one file has no bearing on other files.
0; Flat files offer the functionality to store information, manipulate fields, print or display formatted information and exchange information with others, through email and over the Internet.
0; Some flat files may be attached to external files, such as text editors, to extend functionality and manage related information.
0;Designing flat file databases is simple and requires little design knowledge.
0; Flat files can be developed using just about any database engine.
0; Flat files can be created in relational database engines by not taking advantage of relational design concepts.
0; Designing a relational database takes more planning than flat file databases.
0; With flat files, you may add information, as you deem necessary.
0; With relational databases, you must be careful to store data in tables such that the relationships make sense.
0; Building a relational database is dependant upon your ability to establish a relational model.
0; The model must fully describe how the data is organized, in terms of data structure, integrity, querying, manipulation and storage.
