There are different ways of debugging Toolset plugins, depending on the type of the problem you are facing.

JavaScript debugging is done using the browser s built_in Developer Tools, more specifically, using a JavaScript Console.

 Today, all major browsers feature Developer Tools and a JavaScript Console.

Tools for Debugging.

 Each of the above debugging approaches can be supplemented with debugging tools.
No extractions found.

 For debugging we can apply wide variety of debugging tools such as debugging compilers, dynamic debugging aids, automatic test case generators, memory dumps and cross reference maps.
0.7: (we; can apply; wide variety of debugging tools)
0.473: (wide variety of debugging tools; can be apply for; debugging)

 The following are the main Debugging tools available in the market.

The emerging field of  auditory display  uses sound to convey more detailed information.
0.807: (The emerging field of auditory display; uses; sound)
0.782: (The emerging field of auditory display; uses sound to convey; detailed information)

 For debugging purposes, this requires translating arbitrary data into sound through a process called  sonification  or  audification.
0.707: (arbitrary data; be translating into; sound)
0.705: (arbitrary data; be translating through; a process called sonification or audification)

  Through this process, a language of sound is created.
0.754: (a language of sound; is created through; this process)

 What does this mean  While generating different notes to indicate that a variable   5 or 47 may be less useful, consider using two different notes to indicate bidirectional communications between two programs.
0.654: (a variable 5 or 47; may be; useful)

 The rhythm between the notes conveys how often communications occur, and the relative sizes of the payloads of each message.
0.84: (communications; be the relative sizes of; the payloads of each message)[attrib=The rhythm conveys]

 Music and rhythm are innate tools that in this case would allow us to avoid sifting through pages and pages of interprocessor messaging.
0.658: (us; to avoid sifting through; pages and pages of interprocessor messaging)

 More detailed examples of  sonic grammar  have been termed  Earcons.

Another use of audio_visual thread debugging appears in  Place phone to the PC, please  by Martin Wehlou.

 Martin used a different tune for each thread in a multi_threading program.
0.908: (Martin; used a different tune for each thread in; a multi_threading program)
0.85: (Martin; used; a different tune)
0.779: (a different tune; be used in; a multi_threading program)

 If one thread hangs up , it can be difficult to trace down unless the thread is something obvious like the user display.
0.685: (it; can be; difficult)
0.564: (the thread; is; something obvious)

 But if each thread is associated with a tune, listening to the program until a tune disappears is one way to identify a failure.
0.367: (each thread; is associated with; a tune)

Classification of different types of test tools according to the test process activities.
No extractions found.

 The tools are grouped by the testing activities or areas that are supported by a set of tools, for example, tools that support management activities, tools to support static testing, etc.
0.756: (The tools; are grouped tools that support management activities , tools to support static testing , etc by; the testing activities or areas that are supported by a)
0.674: (The tools; are grouped; tools that support management activities to support static testing)
0.249: (The tools; are grouped tools that support management activities , tools to support static testing , etc for; example)

Other example of the probe effect is when a debugging tool tries to find a particular defect.
0.772: (a debugging tool; tries to find; a particular defect)

 If the code is run with the debugger, then the bug disappears  it only re_appears when the debugger is turned off, hence making it very difficult to find.
0.655: (the bug; disappears; it)
0.198: (the code; is run then with; the debugger)

 These are sometimes known as  Heizenbugs  .

Once an error has been identified, it is necessary to actually find the error in the code.
0.708: (the error; to be actually find in; the code)
0.685: (it; to actually find; the error)
0.632: (it; is; necessary)

 At this point, it can be useful to look at the code s logging and use a stand_alone debugger tool or the debugging component of an integrated development environment .
0.685: (it; can be; useful)
0.454: (it; can be useful at; this point)

 Invariably, the bugs in the functions that get most use are found and fixed first.
No extractions found.

 In some cases, the module that presents the problem is obvious, while the line of code itself is not.
0.653: (the problem; is; obvious)

 In that case, unit tests __ such as JUnit and xUnit, which allow the programmer to run a specific function with specific inputs __ can be helpful in debugging.
0.814: (the programmer; to run a specific function with; specific inputs)
0.747: (the programmer; to run; a specific function)
0.679: (a specific function; to be run with; specific inputs)
0.251: (unit tests;     such as JUnit x Unit , which allow the programmer to run a specific function specific inputs   in; that case)
