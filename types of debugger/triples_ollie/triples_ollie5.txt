KDbg.

KDbg is a graphical user interface to gdb, the GNU debugger.
0.578: (KDbg; is; a graphical user interface to gdb)

 It provides an intuitive interface for setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and stepping through code.
0.767: (It; provides; an intuitive interface)

Direct member.

 For certain compound data types the most important member values are displayed next to the variable name, so that it is not necessary to expand the subtree of that variable in order to see the member value.

0.564: (the most important member values; are displayed in; certain compound data types)
0.422: (it; so is; not necessary)
0.366: (it; so is not necessary for; certain compound data types the most important member values are displayed next to the variable name)

 For example, you don t need to go into a variable of type QString if you want to see the string that the variable holds.

  BTW, this is of course not hardcoded, but can be extended to new types.

  KDbg can even display Qt s QString values, which are Unicode strings.
