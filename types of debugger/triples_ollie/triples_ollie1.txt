Using print statements for debugging a program is often not adequate or convenient.

 For example, the programmer may want to change the values of certain variables after observing the execution of the program till some point.

 Again, if such print statements are placed inside loops, it will produce output everytime the loop is executed though the programmer may be interested in only certain iterations of the loop.

 To overcome several such drawbacks of debugging by inserting extra statements in the program, there are a kind of tool called debugger that helps in debugging programs by giving the programmer some control over the execution of the program and some means of examining and modifying different program variables during runtime.

 The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator , a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered, but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate processor.

Debugging, in computer programming and engineering, is a multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem, and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it.
No extractions found.

 The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works.
