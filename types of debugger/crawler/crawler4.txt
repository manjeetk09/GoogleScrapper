0;Summary.
0; This paper describes some of the new and improved features of the Microsoft  Visual Studio  .
0;NET debugger, such as cross_language debugging, debugging multiple processes across machines, and the generation of minidumps for C   applications.
0; .
0;You can also step between C   code to any .
0;NET Framework language and vice versa.
0; Code written for .
0;NET_based applications can work with C   code through Platform Invoke, COM Interoperability, or through Managed Extensions for C  .
0; You can seamlessly step into and debug from one language to the other, and again, the debugger will have a single callstack showing all the components.
0; To enable debugging between the common language runtime code and C   code running natively, you need to change an option in your launching project settings.
0; In Solution Explorer, locate your startup project .
0; This is the project that gets launched when you press F5.
0; To debug both runtime code and native code, the startup project has to be configured to support both types of debugging.
0; To do this, open your project properties and select the Debugging folder under Configuration Properties.
0; For Visual Basic .
0;NET or Visual C   projects.
0; Make sure the Enable Unmanaged Debugging option is selected.
0; In Visual Basic, this option is selected via a checkbox.
0; In Visual C  this is a drop_down list option.
0; For Visual C   projects.
0; Change the debugger type to Mixed.
0; Note   The Auto option, another option, requires some explanation.
0; It examines your executable file and attempts to determine whether the application will call both native and managed code.
0; Based on the results of the analysis, the appropriate debuggers are used during debugging.
0; A disadvantage of this approach is that if a project was written with managed extensions to C   and dynamically loaded native code, this will not be detected and you will not be able to debug the native code.
0; Setting Mixed allows a developer to directly control the debugging options.
