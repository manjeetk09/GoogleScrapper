In hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree like structure with each record is having one parent record and many children.
0.925: (data; is organized into; a tree)
0.797: (data; is organized in; hierarchical model)

 The main drawback of this model is that, it can have only one to many relationships between nodes.

In the 1960's North American Rockwell together with IBM developed a database processing language called DL/I (Data Language I).  This partnership also produced the IMS (Information Management System) which went on to become the world's leading mainframe hierarchical DBMS of the seventies and eighties..

The hierarchical model was the first database model developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional file system.
0.853: (the first database model; developed to overcome; the limitations of the traditional file system)

  Hierarchical databases were predominantly used for transaction processing where the volume of transactions is large and the transaction operations change little over time.

  For example, the hierarchical database model was particularly popular with banks, because, the way in which banks process savings transactions seldom varies.

The earliest model was the hierarchical database model, resembling an upsidedown tree.
0.719: (The earliest model; was; the hierarchical database model)

 Files are related in a parentchild manner, with each parent capable of relating to more than one child, but each child only being related to one parent.
0.911: (Files; are related with; each parent capable)
0.9: (Files; are related in; a parentchild manner)
0.744: (each child; only being related to; one parent)

 Most of you will be familiar with this kind of structure it s the way most file systems work.

0.569: (it; s; the way)

 There is usually a root, or toplevel, directory that contains various other directories and files.
0.564: (various other directories and files; be contains by; directory)

 Each subdirectory can then contain more files and directories, and so on.
0.729: (Each subdirectory; can then contain; more files and directories)

 As you can see in the image below A1 is the root directory, and its children are B1 and B2.

 B1 is a parent to C1, C2, and C3, which in turn has children of its own.

This model, although being a vast improvement on dealing with unrelated files, has some serious disadvantages.
0.644: (This model; has; some serious disadvantages)

 It represents onetomany relationships well , but it has problems with manytomany relationships.
0.659: (it; has; problems)
0.488: (It; represents well; onetomany relationships)

 Relationships such as that between a product file and an orders file are difficult to implement in a hierarchical model.
No extractions found.

 Specifically, an order can contain many products, and a product can appear in many orders.
0.834: (a product; can appear in; many orders)
0.678: (an order; Specifically can contain a product can appear in many orders; many products)

 Also, the hierarchal model is not flexible because adding new relationships can result in wholesale changes to the existing structure, which in turn means all existing applications need to change as well.
0.659: (the hierarchal model; Also is; not flexible)
0.549: (the existing structure; means in; turn)

 This is not fun when someone has forgotten a table and wants it added to the system shortly before the project is due to launch  And developing the applications is complex because the programmer needs to know the data structure well in order to traverse the model to access the needed data.

 As you ve seen in the earlier chapters, when accessing data from two related tables, you only need to know the fields you require from those two tables.

In figure 1, the node at level 1 is called the root node and the nodes at that has no children are called leaves. For example, node 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11..
0.795: (the node; is called; the root node and the nodes at that has no children are called leaves)
0.754: (the node; is called the root node in; figure 1)

0.562: (no children; has are called; leaves)
0.51: (the node; is called the nodes at that has no children are called leaves in; figure 1)

Nodes that are children of the same parent are called siblings. For example, nodes 2, 3, 4 are siblings..
0.868: (Nodes; are children of; the same parent)
0.779: (Nodes; are called; siblings)

For any node there is a single path called the hierarchical path from the root node. The nodes along this path are called that nodes ancestors..
0.736: (the hierarchical path; be called from; the root node)
0.613: (a single path; is for; any node)

Similarly for a given node, any node along a path from that node to leaf is called its descendent..
0.632: (any node; Similarly for a given node is called; its descendent.)

For example, suppose we have to find out the hierarchical path of node 10, then it will be 1→2→6→10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1, 2 and 6..
0.729: (we; have to find out; the hierarchical path of node 10)
0.584: (it; then will be; 1→2→6→10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1 , 2)

The height of tree is the number of levels on the longest hierarchical path from the root to a leaf. The above tree has a height= 4..
0.939: (The height of tree; is the number of; levels)
0.927: (The height of tree; is the number of levels on; the longest hierarchical path)
0.908: (The height of tree; is the number of levels from; the root)

A tree is said to be balanced if every path from the root node to a leaf has the same length..
0.127: (every path; has; the same length)

Hierarchical database model is a structure of data organized in a treelike model using parent child like relationships, therefore there won t be too many relationships.
