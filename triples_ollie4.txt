Whenever you use a database there is a 99% chance that an index is involved somewhere.
0.774: (you; use; a database)

 The simplest type of index is a sorted listing of the key field.

0.778: (The simplest type of index; is; a sorted listing of the key field)
0.492: (a sorted listing of the key field; be The simplest type of; index)

 This provides a fast lookup because you can use a binary search to locate any item without having to look at each one in turn.

There are different types of tree data structures.

Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes.

0.792: (Binary Tree; is; a special datastructure used for data storage purposes)
0.78: (Binary Tree; is a special datastructure for; data storage purposes)

 A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children.
0.747: (each node; can have; a maximum of two children)
0.712: (A binary tree; has; a special condition)
0.436: (each node; be a maximum of; two children)

 A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which at every level, except possibly the last, has to be completely filled and all nodes are as far left as possible..

A binary tree can be converted into an extended binary tree by adding new nodes to its leaf nodes and to the nodes that have only one child. These new nodes are added in such a way that all the nodes in the resultant tree have either zero or two children. It is also called 2 – tree..
0.929: (A binary tree; can be converted into; an extended binary tree)

Threaded Binary tree is the tree which is represented using pointers the empty sub trees are set to NULL, i.e. ‘left’ pointer of the node whose left child is empty sub tree is normally set to NULL. These large numbers of pointer sets are used in different ways..

Singly linked lists An example of one of the simplest types of graphs is a singly linked list! Now we can start to see the power of the graph data structure, as it can represent very complicated relationships, but also something as simple as a list.

A binary tree is a special kind of tree, one in which all nodes have at most two children.
0.913: (A binary tree; is a special kind of; tree)
0.821: (all nodes; have at; most two children)
0.736: (A binary tree; is; a special kind of tree)

 For a given node in a binary tree, the first child is referred to as the left child, while the second child is referred to as the right child.
0.868: (the first child; is referred as; the left child)[enabler=while the second child is referred to as the right child]
0.838: (the second child; is referred as; the right child)
