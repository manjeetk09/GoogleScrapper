The hierarchical model was the first database model developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional file system.

  Hierarchical databases were predominantly used for transaction processing where the volume of transactions is large and the transaction operations change little over time.

  For example, the hierarchical database model was particularly popular with banks, because, the way in which banks process savings transactions seldom varies.

 Files are related in a parent_child manner, with each parent capable of relating to more than one child, but each child only being related to one parent.

 There is usually a root, or top_level, directory that contains various other directories and files.
0.564: (various other directories and files; be contains by; directory)

 Each subdirectory can then contain more files and directories, and so on.

 As you can see in the image below A1 is the root directory, and its children are B1 and B2.

 B1 is a parent to C1, C2, and C3, which in turn has children of its own.

This model, although being a vast improvement on dealing with unrelated files, has some serious disadvantages.

 Relationships such as that between a product file and an orders file are difficult to implement in a hierarchical model.

 Also, the hierarchal model is not flexible because adding new relationships can result in wholesale changes to the existing structure, which in turn means all existing applications need to change as well.

 This is not fun when someone has forgotten a table and wants it added to the system shortly before the project is due to launch  And developing the applications is complex because the programmer needs to know the data structure well in order to traverse the model to access the needed data.

Hierarchical database model is a structure of data organized in a tree_like model using parent child like relationships, therefore there won t be too many relationships.

 Entity types are related to each other using tree mapping, which is represented by one parent with many child relationships.

0.94: (Parent Child relationships; are all link together by; certain types of data)
