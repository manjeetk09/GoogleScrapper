An example in Groovy that demonstrates the power of this concept.

In computer science, message passing sends a message to a process and relies on the process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the actual code to run.
0.814: (message passing; relies on; the process)
0.814: (message passing; sends a message to; a process)
0.757: (message passing; sends; a message)
0.613: (message passing; sends a message in; computer science)

 Message passing differs from conventional programming where a process, subroutine, or function is directly invoked by name.
0.914: (a process , subroutine , or function; is directly invoked by; name)
0.821: (Message; passing differs from; conventional programming where a process , subroutine , or function is directly invoked by name)
0.769: (differs; be passing from; conventional programming where a process , subroutine , or function is directly invoked by name)
0.564: (a process , subroutine , or function; is directly invoked in; conventional programming)

 Message passing is key to some models of concurrency and object_oriented programming.
0.845: (Message passing; is key to; some models of concurrency)
0.746: (Message passing; is; key)
0.703: (Message passing; object oriented; programming)

One of the first examples of how this can be used was in the domain of computer graphics.
0.903: (One of the first examples; was in; the domain of computer graphics)

 There are all sorts of complexities involved in manipulating graphic objects.

 For example, simply using the right formula to compute the area of an enclosed shape will vary depending on if the shape is a triangle, rectangle, elipse, or circle.
0.176: (the right formula to compute the area of an enclosed shape; be simply using for; example)
0.115: (the shape; is; a triangle , rectangle , elipse , or circle)

 In traditional computer programming this would result in long IF_THEN statements testing what sort of object the shape was and calling the appropriate code.
No extractions found.

 The object_oriented way to handle this is to define a class called Shape with subclasses such as Rectangle and Ellipse and then to simply send a message to any Shape asking it to compute its area.
0.755: (Shape; be called with; subclasses)
0.477: (a message; to to simply send to be; any Shape)

 Each Shape object will then invoke the way code with the formula appropriate for that kind of object.
0.861: (Each Shape object; will then invoke the way code with; the formula appropriate)
0.808: (Each Shape object; will then invoke; the way code)
0.739: (the way code; will be then invoke with; the formula appropriate)

Synchronous message passing is what typical object_oriented programming languages such as Java and Smalltalk use.
0.348: (object_oriented; be programming languages as; Java and Smalltalk use)
0.187: (typical; be object oriented programming languages as; Java and Smalltalk use)

 Asynchronous message passing requires additional capabilities for storing and retransmitting data for systems that may not run concurrently.
0.807: (Asynchronous message passing; requires; additional capabilities)
0.732: (Asynchronous message passing; retransmitting data for; systems that may not run concurrently)
0.692: (Asynchronous message passing; retransmitting; data)
0.661: (data; be retransmitting for; systems that may not run concurrently)

The messages are send and received by passing various variables among specific methods using the signature of the methods.
0.769: (various variables; be passing among; specific methods using the signature of the methods)

 Every methods has a well defined and structured signature.
0.74: (Every methods; has; a well defined and structured signature)

 The signature of a method is composed of a type, associated with the variable whose value after execution of the method, would be returned to the object that would invoke the method  the types of a specific number of variables and the order associated with these variables whose values would be passed to the method before execution of the method starts.
0.943: (The signature of a method; is composed of; a type associated with the variable)
0.865: (whose values; would be passed to; the method)
0.846: (the types of a specific number of variables and the order; be associated with; these variables whose values would be passed to the method before execution of the method starts)
0.833: (whose values; would be passed before; execution)
0.814: (whose value; would be returned to; the object)
0.743: (a type; be associated with; the variable whose value after execution of the method , would be returned to the object that would invoke the method the types of a specific number of variables and the order)

 All these variables have a well defined format and corresponding values at any instant of time available for communication during the execution of the program.
0.853: (these variables; have a well defined format at; any instant of time available)
0.8: (these variables; have corresponding values at; any instant of time available)
0.783: (these variables; have; a well defined format and corresponding values)
0.774: (these variables; have corresponding values during; the execution of the program)
0.714: (these variables; have a well defined format during; the execution of the program)

 Figure below shows an example of a signature for a method  evaluate .

Message passing is a type of communication between processes or objects in computer science.
0.939: (Message passing; is a type of; communication)
0.927: (Message passing; is a type of communication between; processes or objects)
0.804: (Message passing; is; a type of communication)

 In this model, processes or objects can send and receive messages to other processes or objects.
0.708: (messages; can be receive to; other processes or objects)

If we are talking about OOP than the term  message passing  comes from Smalltalk.
0.775: (the term message passing; comes from; Smalltalk)
0.09: (we; are talking about; OOP)[enabler=than the term message passing comes from Smalltalk]

 In a few words the Smalltalk basic principles are.

I think this terms are more or less equivalent.
No extractions found.

 May be the only interesting difference is that message passing always rely on dynamic dispatch and late binding while in the case of method invocation one can use static dispatch and early binding too.
0.714: (message passing; always rely on; dynamic dispatch and late binding)[enabler=while in the case of method invocation one can use static dispatch and early binding too]
0.668: (one; can use too; static dispatch and early binding)
0.659: (one; can use early binding too in; the case of method invocation)
0.659: (one; can use static dispatch too in; the case of method invocation)
0.555: (static dispatch and early binding; can be use too in; the case of method invocation)

 For example, C   does early binding by default until  virtual  keyword appears somewhere.
0.727: (C; does early binding by; default)[enabler=until virtual keyword appears somewhere]
0.155: (C; does early binding for; example)[enabler=until virtual keyword appears somewhere]

Anyway, regardless of which formalism do your programming language use for communication between two objects it s always considered a good OOP style to forbid direct access to instance variables in Smalltalk terminology or data members in C   terminology or whatever term is used in your programming language.
0.885: (whatever term; is used in; your programming language)
0.672: (formalism; do; your programming language use)
0.446: (it; s always considered in; two objects)
