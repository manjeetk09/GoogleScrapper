 Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C   language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users.

0.728: (machine learning possible; to be make by; means of a simple)
0.708: (maximum performance and maximum flexibility; to be provide for; expert users)

 This is done by providing a set of command_line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C   API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.

These are a list of ideas compiled by mlpack developers  they range from simpler code maintenance tasks to difficult machine learning algorithm implementation, which means that there are suitable ideas for a wide range of student abilities and interests.
