An Entity can be any object, place, person or class.
 In ER Diagram, an entity is represented using rectangles.
 Consider an example of an Organisation.
 Employee, Manager, Department, Product and many more can be taken as entities from an Organisation.

Here we are going to design an Entity Relationship  model for a college database .
 Say we have the following statements.
.
The ER model defines the conceptual view of a database.
 It works around realworld entities and the associations among them.
 At view level, the ER model is considered a good option for designing databases.
Let us now learn how the ER Model is represented by means of an ER diagram.
 Any object, for example, entities, attributes of an entity, relationship sets, and attributes of relationship sets, can be represented with the help of an ER diagram.

An entity relationship model  describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge.
 An ER model is composed of entity types  and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types.

Entity relationship modeling was developed for database design by Peter Chen and published in a 1976 paper.
 However, variants of the idea existed previously.
 Some ER modelers show super and subtype entities connected by generalizationspecialization relationships, and an ER model can be used also in the specification of domainspecific ontologies.

An entity relationship model is usually the result of systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of a business.
 It does not define the business processes  it only presents a business data schema in graphical form.
 It is usually drawn in a graphical form as boxes  that are connected by lines  which express the associations and dependencies between entities.
 An ER model can also be expressed in a verbal form, for example  one building may be divided into zero or more apartments, but one apartment can only be located in one building.
