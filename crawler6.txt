0;The types of the database models generally used in the business organizations can be categorized as follows  .
0;There are three types of database models which are common in the industry.
0;  They are the Hierarchical Data Model, the Network Data Model and the Relational Data Model.
0; These models have their own particular nature, and, therefore, they are applicable in the industry where a similar situation exists.
0; There is fourth model known as the Object Data Based Model in which data is structured as objects at a much higher level as compared to the other models providing flexibility in designing the application.
0;Common logical data models for databases include.
0; Hierarchical database model.
0; Network model.
0; Relational model.
0; Entity relationship model Enhanced entity relationship model.

0;A model is a representation of reality,  real world  objects and events, associations.
0; It is an abstraction that concentrates on the essential, inherent aspects an organization and ignores the accidental properties.
0; A data model represents the organization itself.
0; It should provide the basic concepts and notations that will allow database designers and end users unambiguously and accurately to communicate their understanding of the organizational data.
0;Hierarchical Database model is one of the oldest database models, dating from late 1950s.
0; One of the first hierarchical databases Information Management System was developed jointly by North American Rockwell Company and IBM.
0; This model is like a structure of a tree with the records forming the nodes and fields forming the branches of the tree.

0;The tree structure has parts record superior to supplier record.
0; That is parts form the parent and supplier forms the children.
0; Each of the four trees figure, consists of one part record occurrence, together with a set of subordinate supplier record occurrences.
0; There is one supplier record for each supplier of a particular part.
0; Each supplier occurrence includes the corresponding shipment quantity.
