0;The graph of fin this example is the graph of y   x2 _ 3.
0; It is easy to generate points on the graph.
0; Choose a value for the first coordinate, then evaluate f at that number to find the second coordinate.
0; The following table shows several values for x and the function f evaluated at those numbers.

0;First we solve the equation for y.
0;Last we graph our matching x_ and y_values and draw a line.
0;Example.
0;We are going to graph the equation _4x 2y 2.
0;First we solve the equation for y.

0;Here is an example of a graph that is not a function.
0;For example, if you work in a fast food outlet, your pay packet depends on the number of hours you work.
0; Or, the amount of concrete you need to order when constructing a building will depend on the height of the building.

0; Graphs of Functions Defined by Tables of Data _ often we don t have an algebraic expression for a function, just tables.
0;In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
0; Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.

0;The informal definition of an algebraic function provides a number of clues about their properties.
0; To gain an intuitive understanding, it may be helpful to regard algebraic functions as functions which can be formed by the usual algebraic operations.
0; addition, multiplication, division, and taking an nth root.
0; This is something of an oversimplification  because of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, algebraic functions need not be expressible by radicals.

0;However, not every function has an inverse.
0; For example, y   x2 fails the horizontal line test.
0; it fails to be one_to_one.
0; The inverse is the algebraic  function  x     y   displaystyle x  pm   sqrt  y    .
0; Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve.
