0;There are different ways of debugging Toolset plugins, depending on the type of the problem you are facing.
0;JavaScript debugging is done using the browser s built_in Developer Tools, more specifically, using a JavaScript Console.
0; Today, all major browsers feature Developer Tools and a JavaScript Console.
0; In Chrome, click the Main menu button_ More Tools_ Developer Tools.
0; Select the Console tab.
0; In Firefox, click the Main menu button_ Developer_ Web Console.
0; In Internet Explorer, click the Tools button_ F12 Developer Tools.
0; Select the Console tab.

0;Tools for Debugging.
0; Each of the above debugging approaches can be supplemented with debugging tools.
0; For debugging we can apply wide variety of debugging tools such as debugging compilers, dynamic debugging aids, automatic test case generators, memory dumps and cross reference maps.
0; The following are the main Debugging tools available in the market.
0; The following information is based upon details from respective web_sites of the tool vendors.

0;The emerging field of  auditory display  uses sound to convey more detailed information.
0; For debugging purposes, this requires translating arbitrary data into sound through a process called  sonification  or  audification.
0;  Through this process, a language of sound is created.
0; What does this mean  While generating different notes to indicate that a variable   5 or 47 may be less useful, consider using two different notes to indicate bidirectional communications between two programs.
0; The rhythm between the notes conveys how often communications occur, and the relative sizes of the payloads of each message.
0; Music and rhythm are innate tools that in this case would allow us to avoid sifting through pages and pages of interprocessor messaging.
0; More detailed examples of  sonic grammar  have been termed  Earcons.

0;Another use of audio_visual thread debugging appears in  Place phone to the PC, please  by Martin Wehlou.
0; Martin used a different tune for each thread in a multi_threading program.
0; If one thread hangs up , it can be difficult to trace down unless the thread is something obvious like the user display.
0; But if each thread is associated with a tune, listening to the program until a tune disappears is one way to identify a failure.
0;Classification of different types of test tools according to the test process activities.
0; The tools are grouped by the testing activities or areas that are supported by a set of tools, for example, tools that support management activities, tools to support static testing, etc.
0;Other example of the probe effect is when a debugging tool tries to find a particular defect.
0; If the code is run with the debugger, then the bug disappears  it only re_appears when the debugger is turned off, hence making it very difficult to find.
0; These are sometimes known as  Heizenbugs  .

0;Once an error has been identified, it is necessary to actually find the error in the code.
0; At this point, it can be useful to look at the code s logging and use a stand_alone debugger tool or the debugging component of an integrated development environment .
0; Invariably, the bugs in the functions that get most use are found and fixed first.
0; In some cases, the module that presents the problem is obvious, while the line of code itself is not.
0; In that case, unit tests __ such as JUnit and xUnit, which allow the programmer to run a specific function with specific inputs __ can be helpful in debugging.
