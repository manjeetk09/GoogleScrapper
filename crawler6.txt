The ER model defines the conceptual view of a database.
 It works around real world entities and the associations among them.
 At view level  the ER model is considered a good option for designing databases.
Here we are going to design an Entity Relationship  ER  model for a college database .
 Say we have the following statements.

An entity relationship model  ER model  describes inter related things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge.
 An ER model is composed of entity types  which classify the things of interest  and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types.

Entity relationship modeling was developed for database design by Peter Chen and published in a 1976 paper.
 However  variants of the idea existed previously.
 Some ER modelers show super and subtype entities connected by generalization specialization relationships  and an ER model can be used also in the specification of domain specific ontologies.

An entity relationship model is usually the result of systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of a business.
 It does not define the business processes  it only presents a business data schema in graphical form.
 It is usually drawn in a graphical form as boxes  entities  that are connected by lines  relationships  which express the associations and dependencies between entities.
 An ER model can also be expressed in a verbal form  for example  one building may be divided into zero or more apartments  but one apartment can only be located in one building.
