algorithm for hash function;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function; A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it by knowing the stored hash value.;cryptographic_hash_function;0.8749999999999999;0.10526315789473684;1.0;1.9802631578947367;0.0;1;Mon Jun 26 00:26:40 IST 2017;cryptographic_hash_function;isTerminology(relatedTo);hash_function
md5 algorithm for hash function;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/cryptography_hash_functions.htm; For example, file servers often provide a pre_computed MD5 checksum for the files, so that a user can compare the checksum of the downloaded file to it.;checksum;0.6250000000000001;0.0;1.0;1.625;0.7071067811865475;0;Mon Jun 26 00:26:40 IST 2017;checksum;isTerminology(relatedTo);hash_function
