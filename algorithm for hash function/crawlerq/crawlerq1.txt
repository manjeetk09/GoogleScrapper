The MD5 function is a cryptographic algorithm that takes an input of arbitrary length and produces a message digest that is 128 bits long.
 The digest is sometimes also called the  hash  or  fingerprint  of the input.
 MD5 is used in many situations where a potentially long message needs to be processed and or compared quickly.
 The most common application is the creation and verification of digital signatures.
The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128_bit hash value.
 Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.
 It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.

The MD5 hashing algorithm is a one_way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length as input and returns as output a fixed_length digest value to be used for authenticating the original message.

MD5 was most popular and widely used hash function for quite some years.
 The MD family comprises of hash functions MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6.
 It was adopted as Internet Standard RFC 1321.
 It is a 128_bit hash function.
 MD5 digests have been widely used in the software world to provide assurance about integrity of transferred file.
 For example, file servers often provide a pre_computed MD5 checksum for the files, so that a user can compare the checksum of the downloaded file to it.
 In 2004, collisions were found in MD5.
 An analytical attack was reported to be successful only in an hour by using computer cluster.
 This collision attack resulted in compromised MD5 and hence it is no longer recommended for use.

Note.
  Though MD5 is widely known, it is not a very secure hash.
 There exists many attacks such as rainbow table attack.
  The security of the MD5 hash function is severely compromised.
 A collision attack exists that can find collisions within seconds on a computer with a 2.

 Further, there is also a chosen_prefix collision attack that can produce a collision for two inputs with specified prefixes within hours, using off_the_shelf computing hardware .
 The ability to find collisions has been greatly aided by the use of off_the_shelf GPUs.
 On an NVIDIA GeForce 8400GS graphics processor, 16 18 million hashes per second can be computed.
 An NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra can calculate more than 200 million hashes per second   Source.

The algorithm Message Digest 5 or MD5, it is a one_way cryptographic hash function.
 MD5 performs many binary operations on the  message  to compute a 128_bit  hash .
