1;A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.
1; The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.
1; One use is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup.
1; Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file.
1; An example is finding similar stretches in DNA sequences.
1; They are also useful in cryptography.
1; A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it by knowing the stored hash value.
1; This is used for assuring integrity of transmitted data, and is the building block for HMACs, which provide message authentication.

0;A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later.
0; Each position of the hash table, often called a slot, can hold an item and is named by an integer value starting at 0.
0; For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1, a slot named 2, and so on.
0; Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty.
0; We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value None.
0; Figure 4 shows a hash table of size  .
0; In other words, there are m slots in the table, named 0 through 10.

0;What is a good Hash function  I saw a lot of hash function and applications in my data structures courses in college, but I mostly got that it s pretty hard to make a good hash function.
0; As a rule of thumb to avoid collisions my professor said that.
