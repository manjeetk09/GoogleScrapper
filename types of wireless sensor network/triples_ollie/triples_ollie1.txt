The most common WSN architecture follows the OSI architecture Model.
0.74: (The most common WSN architecture; follows; the OSI architecture)

 The architecture of the WSN includes five layers and three cross layers.
0.772: (The architecture of the WSN; includes; five layers and three cross layers)

 Mostly in sensor n w we require five layers, namely application, transport, n w, data link   physical layer.
0.71: (data; link; physical layer)[enabler=Mostly in sensor n w we require five layers , namely application , transport , n w]

 The three cross planes are namely power management, mobility management, and task management.
No extractions found.

 These layers of the WSN are used to accomplish the n w and make the sensors work together in order to raise the complete efficiency of the network.

WSN nodes are typically organized in one of three types of network topologies.
0.937: (WSN nodes; are typically organized in; one of three types of network topologies)

 In a star topology, each node connects directly to a gateway.
0.847: (each node; connects directly to; a gateway)
0.613: (each node; connects directly in; a star topology)

 In a cluster tree network, each node connects to a node higher in the tree and then to the gateway, and data is routed from the lowest node on the tree to the gateway.
0.925: (data; is routed from; the lowest node)
0.906: (data; is routed on; the tree)
0.765: (each node; connects then to the gateway to; a node higher)
0.523: (each node; connects then to the gateway in; a cluster tree network)

 Finally, to offer increased reliability, mesh networks feature nodes that can connect to multiple nodes in the system and pass data through the most reliable path available.
