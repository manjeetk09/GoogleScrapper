A Wireless Sensor Network is one kind of wireless network includes a large number of circulating, self_directed, minute, low powered devices named sensor nodes called motes.

 These networks certainly cover a huge number of spatially distributed, little, battery_operated, embedded devices that are networked to caringly collect, process, and transfer data to the operators, and it has controlled the capabilities of computing   processing.

WSN nodes are typically organized in one of three types of network topologies.
0.937: (WSN nodes; are typically organized in; one of three types of network topologies)

 In a star topology, each node connects directly to a gateway.
0.847: (each node; connects directly to; a gateway)
0.613: (each node; connects directly in; a star topology)

 In a cluster tree network, each node connects to a node higher in the tree and then to the gateway, and data is routed from the lowest node on the tree to the gateway.
0.925: (data; is routed from; the lowest node)
0.906: (data; is routed on; the tree)
0.765: (each node; connects then to the gateway to; a node higher)
0.523: (each node; connects then to the gateway in; a cluster tree network)

 Finally, to offer increased reliability, mesh networks feature nodes that can connect to multiple nodes in the system and pass data through the most reliable path available.

 This mesh link is often referred to as a router .

There are different types of sensor networks such as underground, underwater, terrestrial and multimedia WSNs etc.
