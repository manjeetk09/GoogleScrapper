A Wireless Sensor Network is one kind of wireless network includes a large number of circulating, self_directed, minute, low powered devices named sensor nodes called motes.
 These networks certainly cover a huge number of spatially distributed, little, battery_operated, embedded devices that are networked to caringly collect, process, and transfer data to the operators, and it has controlled the capabilities of computing   processing.
 Nodes are the tiny computers, which work jointly to form the networks.
The main characteristics of a WSN include.
 Power consumption constraints for nodes using batteries or energy harvesting.
 Ability to cope with node failures .
 Some mobility of nodes .
 Heterogeneity of nodes.
 Scalability to large scale of deployment.
 Ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.
 Ease of use.

WSN nodes are typically organized in one of three types of network topologies.
 In a star topology, each node connects directly to a gateway.
 In a cluster tree network, each node connects to a node higher in the tree and then to the gateway, and data is routed from the lowest node on the tree to the gateway.
 Finally, to offer increased reliability, mesh networks feature nodes that can connect to multiple nodes in the system and pass data through the most reliable path available.
 This mesh link is often referred to as a router .
There are different types of sensor networks such as underground, underwater, terrestrial and multimedia WSNs etc.
 We will discuss them briefly.
