The most common WSN architecture follows the OSI architecture Model.
 The architecture of the WSN includes five layers and three cross layers.
 Mostly in sensor n w we require five layers, namely application, transport, n w, data link   physical layer.
 The three cross planes are namely power management, mobility management, and task management.
 These layers of the WSN are used to accomplish the n w and make the sensors work together in order to raise the complete efficiency of the network.

There are different types of sensor networks such as underground, underwater, terrestrial and multimedia WSNs etc.
 We will discuss them briefly.

WSN nodes are typically organized in one of three types of network topologies.
 In a star topology, each node connects directly to a gateway.
 In a cluster tree network, each node connects to a node higher in the tree and then to the gateway, and data is routed from the lowest node on the tree to the gateway.
 Finally, to offer increased reliability, mesh networks feature nodes that can connect to multiple nodes in the system and pass data through the most reliable path available.
 This mesh link is often referred to as a router .
