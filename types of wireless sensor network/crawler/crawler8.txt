0;Mobility models represent the movement of mobile user, and how their location, velocity and acceleration change over time.
0; Such models are frequently used for simulation purposes when new communication or navigation techniques are investigated.
0; Mobility management schemes for mobile communication systems make use of mobility models for predicting future user positions.
