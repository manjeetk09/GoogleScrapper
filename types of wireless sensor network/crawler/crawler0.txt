0;A Wireless Sensor Network is one kind of wireless network includes a large number of circulating, self_directed, minute, low powered devices named sensor nodes called motes.
0; These networks certainly cover a huge number of spatially distributed, little, battery_operated, embedded devices that are networked to caringly collect, process, and transfer data to the operators, and it has controlled the capabilities of computing   processing.
0; Nodes are the tiny computers, which work jointly to form the networks.
0;The main characteristics of a WSN include.
0; Power consumption constraints for nodes using batteries or energy harvesting.
0; Ability to cope with node failures .
0; Some mobility of nodes .
0; Heterogeneity of nodes.
0; Scalability to large scale of deployment.
0; Ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.
0; Ease of use.

0;WSN nodes are typically organized in one of three types of network topologies.
0; In a star topology, each node connects directly to a gateway.
0; In a cluster tree network, each node connects to a node higher in the tree and then to the gateway, and data is routed from the lowest node on the tree to the gateway.
0; Finally, to offer increased reliability, mesh networks feature nodes that can connect to multiple nodes in the system and pass data through the most reliable path available.
0; This mesh link is often referred to as a router .
0;There are different types of sensor networks such as underground, underwater, terrestrial and multimedia WSNs etc.
0; We will discuss them briefly.
