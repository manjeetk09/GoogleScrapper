0;Wireless Sensor networks have become the most interesting regions of exploring in the 21st century.
0; WSNs include a large number of sensor nodes, actuator nodes, gateways, and clients.
0; Recent progress in wireless technologies has facilitated the vast variety of uses of WSNs in the military, traffic observation, target tracking, environment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, and so on.
0; The designers of WSNs have been faced many new challenges, like sensed quantities, the size of nodes, and nodes  autonomy.
0; As a result, improved solutions to these confront and perfections in the modern technologies are required.
0; The prospect expansions in sensor nodes must construct very influential and expenditure effective devices so that they may be used in applications.
0; This paper also describes the modern research challenges for WSNs.
0; And finally it reviews a number of security methods presently planned or implemented in WSNs.
