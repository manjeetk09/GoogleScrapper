1;Terrestrial WSNs are capable of communicating base stations efficiently, and consist of hundreds to thousands of wireless sensor nodes deployed either in unstructured or structured manner.
1; In an unstructured mode, the sensor nodes are randomly distributed within the target area that is dropped from a fixed plane.
1; The preplanned or structured mode considers optimal placement, grid placement, and 2D, 3D placement models.
