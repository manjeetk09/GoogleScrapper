Hi	NNP
All	NNP

Thanks	NNS

the	DT

Very	RB
good	JJ
summary	NN

Thank	VB
One	CD
simple	JJ
point	NN

The	DT
reason	NN
for	IN
taking	VBG
the	DT
log	NN
p	NN
1	CD
p	NN
in	IN
Logistic	NNP
Regression	NN
is	VBZ
to	TO

easy	JJ

Thanks	NNS
Dalila	NNP

That	DT
s	VBZ
not	RB
the	DT
reason	NN
for	IN
taking	VBG
the	DT
log	NN
.	.

The	DT
underlying	VBG
assumption	NN
in	IN
logistic	JJ
regression	NN
is	VBZ
that	IN
the	DT
probability	NN
is	VBZ
governed	VBN
by	IN
a	DT
step	NN
function	NN
whose	WP$
argument	NN
is	VBZ
linear	JJ
in	IN
the	DT
attributes	NNS
.	.

First	NNP
of	IN
all	PDT
the	DT
assumption	NN
of	IN
linearity	NN
or	CC
otherwise	RB
introduces	VBZ
bias	NN
.	.

However	RB
logistic	JJ
regression	NN
being	VBG
a	DT
parametric	JJ
model	NN
some	DT
bias	NN
is	VBZ
inevitable	JJ
.	.

The	DT
reason	NN
to	TO
choose	VB
a	DT
linear	JJ
relationship	NN
is	VBZ
not	RB
because	IN
its	PRP$
easy	JJ
to	TO
solve	VB
but	CC
because	IN
a	DT
higher	JJR
order	NN
polynomial	NN
introduces	VBZ
higher	JJR
bias	NN
and	CC
one	CD
would	MD
not	RB
like	VB
to	TO
do	VB
so	RB
without	IN
good	JJ
reason	NN
.	.

Now	RB
coming	VBG
to	TO
the	DT
choice	NN
of	IN
log	NN
it	PRP
is	VBZ
just	RB
a	DT
convention	NN
.	.

Basically	RB
once	RB
we	PRP
have	VBP
decided	VBN
to	TO
go	VB
with	IN
a	DT
linear	JJ
model	NN
in	IN
the	DT
case	NN
of	IN
one	CD
attribute	NN
we	PRP
model	VBP
the	DT
probability	NN
by	IN
.	.

p	NN
x	NN
f	FW
ax	NN
b	NN
.	.

such	JJ
that	IN
p	NN
infinity	NN
0	CD
and	CC
p	NN
infinity	NN
0	CD
.	.

It	PRP
so	RB
happens	VBZ
that	IN
this	DT
is	VBZ
satisfied	VBN
by	IN
.	.

p	NN
x	CC
exp	NN
ax	NN
b	NN
1	CD
exp	NN
ax	NN
b	NN
.	.

which	WDT
can	MD
be	VB
re	RB
written	VBN
as	IN
.	.

log	NN
p	NN
x	NN
1	CD
p	NN
x	CC
a	DT
x	NN
b	NN
.	.

While	IN
I	PRP
am	VBP
at	IN
it	PRP
it	PRP
may	MD
be	VB
useful	JJ
to	TO
talk	VB
about	IN
another	DT
point	NN
.	.

One	CD
should	MD
ask	VB
is	VBZ
why	WRB
we	PRP
don	VBP
t	NN
use	NN
least	JJS
square	JJ
method	NN
.	.

The	DT
reason	NN
is	VBZ
that	IN
a	DT
yes	RB
no	DT
choice	NN
is	VBZ
a	DT
Bernoulli	NNP
random	JJ
variable	NN
and	CC
thus	RB
we	PRP
estimate	VBP
the	DT
probability	NN
according	VBG
to	TO
maximum	NN
likelihood	NN
wrt	NN
Bernoulli	NNP
process	NN
.	.

For	IN
linear	JJ
regression	NN
the	DT
assumption	NN
is	VBZ
that	IN
the	DT
residuals	NNS
around	IN
the	DT
true	JJ
function	NN
are	VBP
distributed	VBN
according	VBG
to	TO
a	DT
normal	JJ
distribution	NN
and	CC
the	DT
maximum	NN
likelihood	NN
estimate	NN
for	IN
a	DT
normal	JJ
distribution	NN
amounts	NNS
to	TO
the	DT
least	JJS
square	NN
method	NN
.	.

So	RB
deep	RB
down	IN
linear	JJ
regression	NN
and	CC
logistic	JJ
regression	NN
both	CC
use	VBP
maximum	JJ
likelihood	NN
estimates	NNS
.	.

Its	PRP$
just	RB
that	IN
they	PRP
are	VBP
max	NN
likelihoods	NNS
according	VBG
to	TO
different	JJ
distributions	NNS
.	.

Nice	JJ

Hi	NNP
Friends	NNPS
i	FW
m	NN
new	JJ
person	NN
to	TO
these	DT
machine	NN
learning	VBG
algorithms	NNS
.	.

i	LS
have	VBP
some	DT
questions	NNS
.	.

1	CD
we	PRP
have	VBP
so	RB
many	JJ
ML	NN
algorithms	NNS
.	.

but	CC
how	WRB
can	MD
we	PRP
choose	VB
the	DT
algorithms	NNS
which	WDT
one	CD
is	VBZ
suitable	JJ
for	IN
my	PRP$
data	NNS
set	VBN
2	CD
How	WRB
does	VBZ
these	DT
algorithms	NNS
works	VBZ
.	.

3	CD
why	WRB
only	RB
these	DT
particular	JJ
algorithms	NNS
.	.

why	WRB
not	RB
others	NNS
.	.
.	.

Nice	JJ
Article	NNP
.	.
.	.

Thanks	NNS
for	IN
your	PRP$
effort	NN
.	.

hello	UH
.	.

I	PRP
have	VBP
to	TO
implement	VB
machine	NN
learning	NN
algorithms	NNS
in	IN
python	NN
so	RB
could	MD
you	PRP
help	VB
me	PRP
in	IN
this	DT
.	.

any	DT
body	NN
provide	VB
me	PRP
the	DT
proper	JJ
code	NN
for	IN
any	DT
algorithm	NN
.	.

All	DT
programe	NN
has	VBZ
error	NN
named	VBN
Error	NNP
in	IN
model	NN
.	.

frame	NN
.	.

default	NN
formula	NN
as	IN
.	.

list	NN
y	NN
train	NN

data	NNS
x	CC
invalid	JJ
type	NN
list	NN
for	IN
variable	JJ
as	IN
.	.

list	NN
y	NN
train	NN
.	.

What	WP
is	VBZ
that	DT
.	.

I	PRP
think	VBP
that	IN
y	NN
train	NN
is	VBZ
data	NN
frame	NN
and	CC
it	PRP
can	MD
not	RB
be	VB
converted	VBN
directly	RB
to	TO
list	NN
with	IN
as	RB
.	.

list	NN
command	NN
.	.

Try	VB
this	DT
instead	RB
.	.

y	NN
train	NN
as	IN
.	.

list	NN
as	IN
.	.

data	NNS

See	VB
if	IN
this	DT
works	VBZ
for	IN
you	PRP
.	.

Very	RB
nice	JJ
summary	NN
.	.

Can	MD
you	PRP
tell	VB
how	WRB
to	TO
get	VB
machine	NN
learning	NN
problems	NNS
for	IN
practice	NN
.	.

Analytics	NNS
Vidhya	NNP
has	VBZ
some	DT
practice	NN

Check	VB

Also	RB
UCI	NNP
machine	NN
learning	VBG

is	VBZ
a	DT
phenomenal	JJ
place	NN

Google	NNP
it	PRP
and	CC
enjoy	VB

Do	VB
you	PRP
have	VBP
R	NN
