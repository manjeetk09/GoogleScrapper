Database design is a process of modeling an enterprise in the real world.
 In fact, a database itself is a model of the real world that contains selected information needed by the enterprise.
 Many models and languages some formally and mathematically defined, some informal and intuitive are used by designers.
 Here are the ones that we present in this tutorial.
There are many kinds of data models.
 Some of the most common ones include.
 Hierarchical database model.
 Relational model.
 Network model.
 Object_oriented database model.
 Entity_relationship model.
 Document model.
 Entity_attribute_value model.
 Star schema.
 The object_relational model, which combines the two that make up its name.

A Database model defines the logical design of data.
 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
 Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
 They are, Hierarchical Model.
 Network Model.
 Relational Model.

Before you start read up on normalization until you have no questions about it at all.
 If you only did this in school, you probably don t know enough about it to design yet.
I have been given the task to design a database to store a lot of information for our company.
 Because the task is rather big and contains multiple modules where users should be able to do stuff, I m worried about designing a good data model for this.
 I just don t want to end up with a badly designed database.
