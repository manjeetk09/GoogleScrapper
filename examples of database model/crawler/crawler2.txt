0;Database design is a process of modeling an enterprise in the real world.
0; In fact, a database itself is a model of the real world that contains selected information needed by the enterprise.
0; Many models and languages some formally and mathematically defined, some informal and intuitive are used by designers.
0; Here are the ones that we present in this tutorial.
0;There are many kinds of data models.
0; Some of the most common ones include.
0; Hierarchical database model.
0; Relational model.
0; Network model.
0; Object_oriented database model.
0; Entity_relationship model.
0; Document model.
0; Entity_attribute_value model.
0; Star schema.
0; The object_relational model, which combines the two that make up its name.

0;A Database model defines the logical design of data.
0; The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
0; Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
0; They are, Hierarchical Model.
0; Network Model.
0; Relational Model.

0;Before you start read up on normalization until you have no questions about it at all.
0; If you only did this in school, you probably don t know enough about it to design yet.
0;I have been given the task to design a database to store a lot of information for our company.
0; Because the task is rather big and contains multiple modules where users should be able to do stuff, I m worried about designing a good data model for this.
0; I just don t want to end up with a badly designed database.
