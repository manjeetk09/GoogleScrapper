0;A Database model defines the logical design of data.
0; The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
0; Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
0; They are, Hierarchical Model.
0; Network Model.
0; Relational Model.
0;     .
0;Database systems can be based on different data models or database models respectively.
0; A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database.
0; Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively.
0; The most often used data models are.
0;High_level Conceptual Data models.
0;.
0;Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled.
0; Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS.
0; Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.
0;Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes.
0; Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain.
0; For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity.
0; Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc.

0;Relationship   The logical association among entities is called relationship  Relationships are mapped with entities in various ways  Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities  Mapping cardinalities   one to one one to many many to one many to many.

0;In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments.
0; The record structure and some sample records for supplier, parts and shipments elements are as given in following tables.
