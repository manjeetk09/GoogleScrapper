0;A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally_described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.
0; The relational database was invented by E.
0; F.
0; Codd at IBM in 1970.

0;A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.
0; Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.
0; Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.
0; For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth.
0; Another table would describe an order.
0; product, customer, date, sales price, and so forth.
0; A user of the database could obtain a view of the database that fitted the user s needs.
0; For example, a branch office manager might like a view or report on all customers that had bought products after a certain date.
0; A financial services manager in the same company could, from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that needed to be paid.

0;The relational data model describes the world as  a collection of inter_related relations  .
0;.
0;The principal storage units are called columns, or fields, or attributes.
0; These will house the basic components of data that your content can be broken down into.
0; When deciding which fields to create you need to think generically about your information.
0;  For example, drawing out the common components of the information that you will store in the database, and avoiding the specifics that distinguish one item from another.
0;.
0; The  Relational Database Model is the most common model in industry today.
0;  A relational database is based on the relational model developed by E.
0;F.
0; Codd.
0; A relational database allows the definition of data structures, storage and retrieval operations and integrity constraints.
0; In such a database the data and relations between them are organized into tables.
0; A table is a collection of records and each record in a table contains the same fields.
0;   The contents of a table can be permanently saved for future use.

0;Certain fields may be designated as keys, which means that searches for specific values of that field will use indexing to speed them up and more importantly, uniquely identify each entity.
0;  There are many types of keys, however, quite possibly the two most important are the primary key and the foreign key.
0;  The primary key is what uniquely identifies each entity.
0;  The foreign key is a primary key of one table that also sits in another table.
0;  Ultimately, the use of foreign keys is the heart of the relational database model.
0;  This linkage that the foreign key provides is what allows tables to pull data from each other and link data together.
0;  Where fields in two different tables take values from the same set, a join operation can be performed to select related records in the two tables by matching values in those fields.
0; Most often, but not always, the fields will have the same name in both tables.
0; For example, an  orders  table might contain pairs and a  products  table might contain pairs so to calculate a given customer s bill you would sum the prices of all products ordered by that customer by joining on the product_code fields of the two tables.
0; This can be extended to joining multiple tables on multiple fields.
0; Because these relationships are only specified at retrieval time, relational databases are classed as dynamic database management system.
0;   Also, another important role of the primary key is called  determination .
0;  What this means is that if you know the value of attribute X, you can determine the value of attribute Y.
0;    The relational database model is based on the Relational Algebra.
0;  Which means that operations in the relational database model are based on Select, Project, Join, Intersect, Union, Difference, and Product.
0;  Here is a brief description of each operation.

0;The relational database model consists of three parts.
0; data structure , data integrity, and data manipulation.
0; The data structure model defines how to represent data.
0; Most basic to the data structure model is the relation which is illustrated below.
0;Another fundamental part of the relation model data structure is the concept of a domain.
0; Simply stated, a domain combines two pieces of information _ the set of allowable values that an attribute , and the semantics of the values.
0;  In other words, a domain defines a set of allowable values.
0; For example, for the ID column the domain is the set of all integers greater than zero, whereas for the Dept column the domain is the set of   Sales, Marketing, Research, Accountancy .
