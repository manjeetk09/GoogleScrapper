0;ER diagrams are visual tools that are used in the Entity_Relationship model initially proposed by Peter Chen in 1976 to create a uniform convention that considers both relational database and network views.
0; Chen envisioned the ER model as a conceptual modeling approach that views real world data as systems of entities and relationships.
0; Entities are data objects that maintain different relationships with each other.
0; Additionally, entities are also described further using attributes.
0; Since 1976, the ER model has been expanded and is sometimes used in business management, product development, and strategy formulations.
0; However, database design remains its primary application.

0;Here we are going to design an Entity Relationship model for a college database .
0; Say we have the following statements.
0;The ER model defines the conceptual view of a database.
0; It works around real_world entities and the associations among them.
0; At view level, the ER model is considered a good option for designing databases.
0;ER models are represented by ER diagrams.
