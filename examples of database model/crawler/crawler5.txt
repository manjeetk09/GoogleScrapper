0;The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships.
0; Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.

0;What is a Database Model .
0;                A database model is a structure or a format of a database.
0;Network Database Model.
0; Network Database Model.
0;A Database model defines the logical design of data.
0; The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
0; Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
0; They are, Hierarchical Model.
0; Network Model.
0; Relational Model.

0;In the network model, entities are organised in a graph,in which some entities can be accessed through several path.

0;The Network model replaces the hierarchical tree with a graph thus allowing more general connections among the nodes.
0; The main difference of the network model from the hierarchical model, is its ability to handle many to many  N.
0;N  relations.
0; In other words, it allows a record to have more than one parent.
0; Suppose an employee works for two departments.
0; The strict hierarchical arrangement is not possible here and the tree becomes a more generalized graph _ a network.
0; The network model was evolved to specifically handle non_hierarchical relationships.
0; As shown below data can belong to more than one parent.
0; Note that there are lateral connections as well as top_down connections.

0;Considering again the sample supplier_part database, its network view is shown.
0; In addition to the part and supplier record types, a third record type is introduced which we will call as the connector.
0; A connector occurrence specifies the association between one supplier and one part.
0; It contains data describing the association between supplier and part records.
