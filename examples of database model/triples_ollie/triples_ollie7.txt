An object_oriented database is a database that subscribes to a model with information represented by objects.
0.736: (An object_oriented database; is; a database that subscribes to a model with information)
0.705: (information; be represented by; objects)
0.616: (a database; be subscribes to; a model)

 Object_oriented databases are a niche offering in the relational database management system field and are not as successful or well_known as mainstream database engines.

As the name implies, the main feature of object_oriented databases is allowing the definition of objects, which are different from normal database objects.
0.667: (the main feature of object_oriented databases; is allowing; the definition of objects)[enabler=As the name implies]

 Objects, in an object_oriented database, reference the ability to develop a product, then define and name it.
0.815: (Objects; reference the ability to be develop a product in; an object_oriented database)

 The object can then be referenced, or called later, as a unit without having to go into its complexities.
0.911: (The object; can then be referenced as; a unit)

 This is very similar to objects used in object_oriented programming.
0.705: (objects; be used in; object_oriented programming)

 A real_life parallel to objects is a car engine.
0.762: (A real_life; parallel to objects is; a car engine)

 It is composed of several parts.
0.896: (It; is composed of; several parts)

 the main cylinder block, the exhaust system, intake manifold and so on.

 Each of these is a standalone component  but when machined and bolted into one object, they are now collectively referred to as an engine.
0.92: (they; are now collectively referred as; an engine)

 Similarly, when programming one can define several components, such as a vertical line intersecting a perpendicular horizontal line while both lines have a graded measurement.
0.729: (programming one; can define; several components)[enabler=while both lines have a graded measurement]
0.592: (both lines; have; a graded measurement)
0.24: (several; be components as; a vertical line intersecting)

 This object can then be collectively labeled a graph.
0.763: (This object; can then be collectively labeled; a graph)

 When utilizing the ability to plot components, there is no need to first define a graph  but rather the instance of the created graph can be called.

There are two types of object based data Models   Entity Relationship Model and Object oriented data model.
No extractions found.

 ER data model is one of the important data model which forms the basis for the all the designs in the database world.
0.724: (ER data model; is; one of the important data model)
0.564: (the basis; be forms by; the important data model)

 It defines the mapping between the entities in the database.
0.722: (It; defines; the mapping)

 Object oriented data model, along with the mapping between the entities, describes the state of each entity and the tasks performed by them.
0.82: (Object oriented data model; describes; the state of each entity and the tasks performed by them)
0.774: (the state of each entity and the tasks; be performed by; them)

Consider the example above.

 It maps entities like Student, Lecturer, Subjects, and Marks with each other to form the relation among them.
0.631: (the relation; to be form among; them)
0.595: (It; be maps entities like; Student)
0.543: (It; be Marks with; each other)

 It also list attributes of each objects.
0.74: (It; also list; attributes of each objects)

 ER model represents the all these entities, attributes and their relationship in the form of picture to make the developer understand the system better.
0.806: (ER model; represents; the all these entities , attributes and their relationship in the form of picture to make the developer understand the system better)
0.591: (the developer; understand better; the system)

 A simple ER diagram for above example can be drawn as below.

 Are you able to understand what are the entities involved, what are its attributes and their relations that we were discussing better here  Yes, it is clean and clear what a STUDENT database look like.
0.685: (it; is; clean and clear)

 It gives the clear understanding of how they are scattered and mapped.
0.631: (It; gives; the clear understanding how they are scattered and mapped)

 If we have missed any entities or attribute or the mapping, we can easily identify here.
0.059: (we; have missed; any entities or attribute or the mapping)

 If we represent it in some tables, it would be difficult to identify this gap.
0.685: (it; would be; difficult)
0.084: (we; represent it in; some tables)
0.064: (we; represent; it)

Let us consider an Employee database to understand this model better.
0.811: (us; consider; an Employee database to understand this model better)

 In this database we have different types of employees   Engineer, Accountant, Manager, Clark.
0.68: (we; have; different types of employees)
0.218: (we; have different types of employees Engineer , Accountant , Manager , Clark in; this database)

 But all these employees belong to Person group.
0.812: (these employees; belong to; Person group)

 Person can have different attributes like name, address, age and phone.
0.822: (Person; can have; different attributes)
0.541: (Person; be different attributes like; name , address , age and phone)

 What do we do if we want to get a person s address and phone number  We write two separate procedure sp_getAddress and sp_getPhone.
0.703: (a person; s; address and phone number We write two separate procedure sp_getAddress and sp_getPhone)
0.658: (We; write; two separate procedure sp_getAddress and sp_getPhone)

Object oriented databases are also called Object Database Management Systems .
0.736: (Object oriented databases; are also called; Object Database Management Systems)

 Object databases store objects rather than data such as integers, strings or real numbers.
0.75: (Object databases; store objects than; data)
0.723: (Object databases; store; objects)

 Objects are used in object oriented languages such as Smalltalk, C  , Java, and others.
0.9: (Objects; are used in; object oriented languages)
0.348: (oriented; be languages as; Smalltalk , C , Java , and others)

 Objects basically consist of the following.
No extractions found.

 Attributes _ Attributes are data which defines the characteristics of an object.
0.564: (the characteristics of an object; be defines by; data)

 This data may be simple such as integers, strings, and real numbers or it may be a reference to a complex object.
0.864: (it; may be a reference to; a complex object)
0.821: (This data; may be; simple such as integers , strings , and real numbers or it may be a reference)
0.753: (This data; may be simple as; integers)

 Methods _ Methods define the behavior of an object and are what was formally called procedures or functions.
0.789: (Methods; define; the behavior of an object)

Objects don t require assembly and disassembly saving coding time and execution time to assemble or disassemble objects .
