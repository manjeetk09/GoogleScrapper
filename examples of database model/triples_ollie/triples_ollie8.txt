A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas.

0.825: (A flat database; is; a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table)
0.655: (each database; is represented in; a simple database system)

 The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file.
0.898: (The table; be physically represented as; a simple text file)

 Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships.

0.761: (they; are not unsuitable of; the limitations of flat databases)

 However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database.
