ER diagrams are visual tools that are used in the Entity_Relationship model initially proposed by Peter Chen in 1976 to create a uniform convention that considers both relational database and network views.

 Chen envisioned the ER model as a conceptual modeling approach that views real world data as systems of entities and relationships.
