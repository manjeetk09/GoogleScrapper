 For example, when it comes to conceptual modeling ORM diagrams aren t your only option   In addition to LDMs it is quite common for people to create UML class diagrams and even Class Responsibility Collaborator cards instead.

  In fact, my experience is that CRC cards are superior to ORM diagrams because it is very easy to get project stakeholders actively involved in the creation of the model.

 Instead of a traditional, analyst_led drawing session you can instead facilitate stakeholders through the creation of CRC cards.

A data structure diagram is a diagram and data model used to describe conceptual data models by providing graphical notations which document entities and their relationships, and the constraints that bind them.

0.78: (a diagram and data model; to describe; conceptual data models)
0.667: (A data structure diagram; is; a diagram and data model)

 The basic graphic elements of DSDs are boxes, representing entities, and arrows, representing relationships.
0.545: (boxes , representing entities , and arrows; be The basic graphic elements of; DSDs)

 Data structure diagrams are most useful for documenting complex data entities.
