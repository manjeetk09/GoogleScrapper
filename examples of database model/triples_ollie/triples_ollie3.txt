A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally_described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.

A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.
0.924: (A relational database; is a set of; tables containing data)
0.793: (data; be fitted into; predefined categories)
0.736: (A relational database; is; a set of tables)

 Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.

The principal storage units are called columns, or fields, or attributes.
No extractions found.

 A relational database allows the definition of data structures, storage and retrieval operations and integrity constraints.
0.799: (A relational database; allows; the definition of data)

 In such a database the data and relations between them are organized into tables.
0.914: (the data and relations; are organized into; tables)
0.625: (the data and relations; are organized in; such a database)

 A table is a collection of records and each record in a table contains the same fields.

0.804: (A table; is; a collection of records and each record)
0.772: (a collection of records and each record; contains; the same fields)

Certain fields may be designated as keys, which means that searches for specific values of that field will use indexing to speed them up and more importantly, uniquely identify each entity.
0.933: (Certain fields; may be designated as; keys which means that searches for specific values of that field will use indexing to speed them up and more importantly , uniquely identify each entity)
0.712: (searches; will use; indexing)
0.533: (searches; will more importantly uniquely identify; each entity)
0.48: (searches; will use indexing to speed up; them)
0.45: (searches; to speed up; them)

  There are many types of keys, however, quite possibly the two most important are the primary key and the foreign key.
No extractions found.

  The primary key is what uniquely identifies each entity.
No extractions found.

  The foreign key is a primary key of one table that also sits in another table.
0.955: (The foreign key; is a primary key of; one table that also sits in another table)
0.738: (one table; also sits in; another table)
0.736: (The foreign key; is; a primary key of one table)

  Ultimately, the use of foreign keys is the heart of the relational database model.
0.926: (the use of foreign keys; is the heart of; the relational database model)
0.768: (the use of foreign keys; is; the heart of the relational database model)
0.508: (foreign keys; be the use of; the relational database model)
0.399: (the heart of the relational database model; be the use of; foreign keys)

  This linkage that the foreign key provides is what allows tables to pull data from each other and link data together.
0.799: (tables; to pull data from; each other and link data)
0.798: (tables; to pull; data)
0.658: (data; to be pull from; each other and link data)

  Where fields in two different tables take values from the same set, a join operation can be performed to select related records in the two tables by matching values in those fields.
0.731: (fields; take values from; the same set)
0.73: (fields; take; values)
0.665: (related records; to be select in; the two tables)
0.608: (values; be matching in; those fields)

 Most often, but not always, the fields will have the same name in both tables.
0.78: (the same name; Most often , but not always will be have in; both tables)
0.756: (the fields; Most often , but not always will have; the same name)
0.659: (the fields; Most often , but not always will have the same name in; both tables)

 For example, an  orders  table might contain pairs and a  products  table might contain pairs so to calculate a given customer s bill you would sum the prices of all products ordered by that customer by joining on the product_code fields of the two tables.
0.796: (you; would sum; the prices of all products)
0.676: (all products; be ordered by; that customer)
0.668: (pairs; so to calculate; a given customer)
0.231: (an orders table; might contain for; example)

 This can be extended to joining multiple tables on multiple fields.
0.608: (multiple tables; be joining on; multiple fields)

 Because these relationships are only specified at retrieval time, relational databases are classed as dynamic database management system.
0.914: (relational databases; are classed as; dynamic database management system)[enabler=Because these relationships are only specified at retrieval time]
0.841: (these relationships; are only specified at; retrieval time)

   Also, another important role of the primary key is called  determination .
0.704: (another important role of the primary key; Also is called; determination)

  What this means is that if you know the value of attribute X, you can determine the value of attribute Y.
0.868: (you; can determine; the value of attribute Y)[enabler=if you know the value of attribute X]
0.133: (you; know; the value of attribute X)

    The relational database model is based on the Relational Algebra.
0.914: (The relational database model; is based on; the Relational Algebra)

  Which means that operations in the relational database model are based on Select, Project, Join, Intersect, Union, Difference, and Product.
0.851: (operations; are based on; Select)
0.494: (Select; are based on; Project)

  Here is a brief description of each operation.

The relational database model consists of three parts.

 The data structure model defines how to represent data.
No extractions found.

 Most basic to the data structure model is the relation which is illustrated below.
No extractions found.

Another fundamental part of the relation model data structure is the concept of a domain.
0.93: (Another fundamental part of the relation model data structure; is the concept of; a domain)
0.778: (Another fundamental part of the relation model data structure; is; the concept of a domain)
0.492: (the concept of a domain; be Another fundamental part of; the relation model data structure)
0.355: (fundamental; be part of; the relation model data structure)

 Simply stated, a domain combines two pieces of information _ the set of allowable values that an attribute , and the semantics of the values.
0.846: (a domain; combines; two pieces of information)[enabler=Simply stated]
0.833: (a domain; combines of; information)[enabler=Simply stated]
0.796: (a domain; combines  ; the set of allowable values)[enabler=Simply stated]

  In other words, a domain defines a set of allowable values.
0.825: (a domain; defines; a set of allowable values)
0.613: (a domain; defines a set of allowable values in; other words)

 For example, for the ID column the domain is the set of all integers greater than zero, whereas for the Dept column the domain is the set of   Sales, Marketing, Research, Accountancy .
0.909: (the domain; is the set of; Sales)
0.909: (the domain; is the set of; all integers)[enabler=whereas for the Dept column the domain is the set of Sales , Marketing , Research , Accountancy]
0.863: (the domain; is the set of all integers than; zero)[enabler=whereas for the Dept column the domain is the set of Sales , Marketing , Research , Accountancy]
0.746: (the domain; is the set of all integers for; the ID column)[enabler=whereas for the Dept column the domain is the set of Sales , Marketing , Research , Accountancy]
0.724: (the domain; is; the set of Sales)
0.724: (the domain; is; the set of all integers)
0.67: (the domain; is the set of Sales for; the Dept column)
0.45: (the domain; is the set of all integers for; example)[enabler=whereas for the Dept column the domain is the set of Sales , Marketing , Research , Accountancy]
