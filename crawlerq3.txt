A given database management system may provide one or more models
 The optimal structure depends on the natural organization of the application s data, and on the application s requirements, which include transaction rate , reliability, maintainability, scalability, and cost
 Most database management systems are built around one particular data model, although it is possible for products to offer support for more than one model
Various physical data models can implement any given logical model
 Most database software will offer the user some level of control in tuning the physical implementation, since the choices that are made have a significant effect on performance
A model is not just a way of structuring data
 The relational model, for example, defines operations such as select and join
 Although these operations may not be explicit in a particular query language, they provide the foundation on which a query language is built

The flat model consists of a single, two_dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another
The flat model consists of a single, two_dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another
 For instance, columns for name and password that might be used as a part of a system security database
 Each row would have the specific password associated with an individual user
 This tabular format is a precursor to the relational model
These models were popular in the 1960s, 1970s, but nowadays can be found primarily in old legacy systems
 They are characterized primarily by being navigational with strong connections between their logical and physical representations, and deficiencies in data independence
In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree_like structure, implying a single parent for each record
In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree_like structure, implying a single parent for each record
 A sort field keeps sibling records in a particular order
 Hierarchical structures were widely used in the early mainframe database management systems, such as the Information Management System by IBM, and now describe the structure of XML documents
 This structure allows one one_to_many relationship between two types of data
 This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world  recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs verses, any nested and sorted information
 This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world  recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs verses, any nested and sorted information
This hierarchy is used as the physical order of records in storage
 Such limitations have been compensated for in later IMS versions by additional logical hierarchies imposed on the base physical hierarchy
The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing many_to_many relationships in a tree_like structure that allows multiple parents
 It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification
 It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification
The network model organizes data using two fundamental concepts, called records and sets
 Records contain fields 
 Sets define one_to_many relationships between records
 one owner, many members
 A record may be an owner in any number of sets, and a member in any number of sets
g
, type A is the owner of B
 At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A
 Thus all the sets comprise a general directed graph , or network construct
 Access to records is either sequential or by navigation in the circular linked lists
The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
 a program maintains a current position, and navigates from one record to another by following the relationships in which the record participates
 Records can also be located by supplying key values
Although it is not an essential feature of the model, network databases generally implement the set relationships by means of pointers that directly address the location of a record on disk
 This gives excellent retrieval performance, at the expense of operations such as database loading and reorganization
Popular DBMS products that utilized it were Cincom Systems  Total and Cullinet s IDMS
 IDMS gained a considerable customer base  in the 1980s, it adopted the relational model and SQL in addition to its original tools and languages

Most object databases use the navigational concept to provide fast navigation across networks of objects, generally using object identifiers as  smart  pointers to related objects
In an inverted file or inverted index, the contents of the data are used as keys in a lookup table, and the values in the table are pointers to the location of each instance of a given content item

The relational model was introduced by E
F

 relations, attributes, and domains
 A relation is a table with columns and rows
 The named columns of the relation are called attributes, and the domain is the set of values the attributes are allowed to take
The basic data structure of the relational model is the table, where information about a particular entity is represented in rows and columns

 As a result, each tuple of the employee table represents various attributes of a single employee
 First, the ordering of columns is immaterial in a table
 Second, there can t be identical tuples or rows in a table
A relational database contains multiple tables, each similar to the one in the  flat  database model
 One of the strengths of the relational model is that, in principle, any value occurring in two different records , implies a relationship among those two records
 Yet, in order to enforce explicit integrity constraints, relationships between records in tables can also be defined explicitly, by identifying or non_identifying parent_child relationships characterized by assigning cardinality  1
1, 1
M, M
M 
 Tables can also have a designated single attribute or a set of attributes that can act as a  key , which can be used to uniquely identify each tuple in the table
 For example, an Employee table may contain a column named Location which contains a value that matches the key of a Location table
 Any column can be a key, or multiple columns can be grouped together into a compound key
 It is not necessary to define all the keys in advance  a column can be used as a key even if it was not originally intended to be one

 If no natural key is suitable , an arbitrary or surrogate key can be assigned 
 In practice, most databases have both generated and natural keys, because generated keys can be used internally to create links between rows that cannot break, while natural keys can be used, less reliably, for searches and for integration with other databases

The dimensional model is a specialized adaptation of the relational model used to represent data in data warehouses in a way that data can be easily summarized using online analytical processing, or OLAP queries
 In the dimensional model, a database schema consists of a single large table of facts that are described using dimensions and measures
 A dimension provides the context of a fact and is used in queries to group related facts together
 A dimension provides the context of a fact and is used in queries to group related facts together
 A measure is a quantity describing the fact, such as revenue
 It is important that measures can be meaningfully aggregated for example, the revenue from different locations can be added together
In an OLAP query, dimensions are chosen and the facts are grouped and aggregated together to create a summary
In an OLAP query, dimensions are chosen and the facts are grouped and aggregated together to create a summary
 An alternative physical implementation, called a snowflake schema, normalizes multi_level hierarchies within a dimension into multiple tables
A data warehouse can contain multiple dimensional schemas that share dimension tables, allowing them to be used together
 Coming up with a standard set of dimensions is an important part of dimensional modeling

 Codd s Information Principle, which requires that
 For example, they allow representation of a directed graph with trees on the nodes
 The German company sones implements this concept in its GraphDB
Some post_relational products extend relational systems with non_relational features
 Others arrived in much the same place by adding relational features to pre_relational systems
 Others arrived in much the same place by adding relational features to pre_relational systems
 Paradoxically, this allows products that are historically pre_relational, such as PICK and MUMPS, to make a plausible claim to be post_relational
The resource space model is a non_relational data model based on multi_dimensional classification
The resource space model is a non_relational data model based on multi_dimensional classification
Graph databases allow even more general structure than a network database  any node may be connected to any other node
Multivalue databases are  lumpy  data, in that they can store exactly the same way as relational databases, but they also permit a level of depth which the relational model can only approximate using sub_tables
 This is nearly identical to the way XML expresses data, where a given field attribute can have multiple right answers at the same time
 Multivalue can be thought of as a compressed form of XML
An example is an invoice, which in either multivalue or relational data could be seen as Invoice Header Table _ one entry per invoice, and Invoice Detail Table _ one entry per line item
 In the multivalue model, we have the option of storing the data as on table, with an embedded table to represent the detail
 Invoice Table _ one entry per invoice, no other tables needed
 This also results in fewer reads, less referential integrity issues, and a dramatic decrease in the hardware needed to support a given transaction volume
 This aims to avoid the object_relational impedance mismatch _ the overhead of converting information between its representation in the database and its representation in the application program 
 Even further, the type system used in a particular application can be defined directly in the database, allowing the database to enforce the same data integrity invariants
A variety of these ways have been triedfor storing objects in a database
 This typically requires the addition of some kind of query language, since conventional programming languages do not have the ability to find objects based on their information content
 This typically requires the addition of some kind of query language, since conventional programming languages do not have the ability to find objects based on their information content
 Others have attacked the problem from the database end, by defining an object_oriented data model for the database, and defining a database programming language that allows full programming capabilities as well as traditional query facilities
 usually specialized applications such as engineering databases or molecular biology databases rather than mainstream commercial data processing
An alternative to translating between objects and relational databases is to use an object_relational mapping library

A database model shows the logical structure of a database, including the relationships and constraints that determine how data can be stored and accessed
 Individual database models are designed based on the rules and concepts of whichever broader data model the designers adopt
 Most data models can be represented by an accompanying database diagram
There are many kinds of data models
 Some of the most common ones include
 Hierarchical database model
 Relational model
 Network model
 Object_oriented database model
 Entity_relationship model
 Document model
 Entity_attribute_value model
 Star schema
 The object_relational model, which combines the two that make up its name
You may choose to describe a database with any one of these depending on several factors
 The biggest factor is whether the database management system you are using supports a particular model
 Most database management systems are built with a particular data model in mind and require their users to adopt that model, although some do support multiple models
In addition, different models apply to different stages of the database design process
 High_level conceptual data models are best for mapping out relationships between data in ways that people perceive that data
 Record_based logical models, on the other hand, more closely reflect ways that the data is stored on the server
Selecting a data model is also a matter of aligning your priorities for the database with the strengths of a particular model, whether those priorities include speed, cost reduction, usability, or something else
Selecting a data model is also a matter of aligning your priorities for the database with the strengths of a particular model, whether those priorities include speed, cost reduction, usability, or something else
Let s take a closer look at some of the most common database models
The most common model, the relational model sorts data into tables, also known as relations, each of which consists of columns and rows
 Each column lists an attribute of the entity in question, such as price, zip code, or birth date
The model also accounts for the types of relationships between those tables, including one_to_one, one_to_many, and many_to_many relationships
 Here s an example
Within the database, tables can be normalized, or brought to comply with normalization rules that make the database flexible, adaptable, and scalable
 When normalized, each piece of data is atomic, or broken into the smallest useful pieces
 The model was introduced by E
F
 Codd in 1970
The hierarchical model organizes data into a tree_like structure, where each record has a single parent or root
The hierarchical model organizes data into a tree_like structure, where each record has a single parent or root
 Sibling records are sorted in a particular order
 That order is used as the physical order for storing the database
 This model is good for describing many real_world relationships
The network model builds on the hierarchical model by allowing many_to_many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent records
The network model builds on the hierarchical model by allowing many_to_many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent records
 Each set consists of one owner or parent record and one or more member or child records
 A record can be a member or child in multiple sets, allowing this model to convey complex relationships
 A record can be a member or child in multiple sets, allowing this model to convey complex relationships
It was most popular in the 70s after it was formally defined by the Conference on Data Systems Languages 
This model defines a database as a collection of objects, or reusable software elements, with associated features and methods
 There are several kinds of object_oriented databases
A hypertext database allows any object to link to any other object
 It s useful for organizing lots of disparate data, but it s not ideal for numerical analysis
The object_oriented database model is the best known post_relational database model, since it incorporates tables, but isn t limited to tables
This hybrid database model combines the simplicity of the relational model with some of the advanced functionality of the object_oriented database model
 In essence, it allows designers to incorporate objects into the familiar table structure
Languages and call interfaces include SQL3, vendor languages, ODBC, JDBC, and proprietary call interfaces that are extensions of the languages and interfaces used by the relational model
Languages and call interfaces include SQL3, vendor languages, ODBC, JDBC, and proprietary call interfaces that are extensions of the languages and interfaces used by the relational model
This model captures the relationships between real_world entities much like the network model, but it isn t as directly tied to the physical structure of the database
 Instead, it s often used for designing a database conceptually
Here, the people, places, and things about which data points are stored are referred to as entities, each of which has certain attributes that together make up their domain
Here, the people, places, and things about which data points are stored are referred to as entities, each of which has certain attributes that together make up their domain
 The cardinality, or relationships between entities, are mapped as well
A common form of the ER diagram is the star schema, in which a central fact table connects to multiple dimensional tables

A variety of other database models have been or are still used today
A database built with the inverted file structure is designed to facilitate fast full text searches
 In this model, data content is indexed as a series of keys in a lookup table, with the values pointing to the location of the associated files

The flat model is the earliest, simplest data model
 In order to access or manipulate the data, the computer has to read the entire flat file into memory, which makes this model inefficient for all but the smallest data sets

This is a variation of the relational model designed to facilitate improved analytical processing
Each cell in a dimensional database contains data about the dimensions tracked by the database
 Here the distinction between data and schema is vague at best
 This model is useful for describing systems, such as certain Web_based data sources, which we treat as databases but cannot constrain with a schema
 It cobbles together elements from object_oriented, semistructured, and network models
This model divides all the data points based on whether they describe an entity or an association
This model divides all the data points based on whether they describe an entity or an association
 In this model, an entity is anything that exists independently, whereas an association is something that only exists in relation to something else
The associative model structures the data into two sets
 A set of items, each with a unique identifier, a name, and a type
 The stored fact has to do with the source, and each of the three identifiers may refer either to a link or an item
Other, less common database models include
 Named graph
 Triplestore
The multivalue model, which breaks from the relational model by allowing attributes to contain a list of data rather than a single data point

The multivalue model, which breaks from the relational model by allowing attributes to contain a list of data rather than a single data point
The document model, which is designed for storing and managing documents or semi_structured data, rather than atomic data
Most websites rely on some kind of database to organize and present data to users
 Whenever someone uses the search functions on these sites, their search terms are converted into queries for a database server to process
The broad presence of databases allows them to be used in almost any field, from online shopping to micro_targeting a voter segment as part of a political campaign

 It helps in designing a database and serves as blueprint for application developers and database administrators in creating a database
 Depending on the model in use, a database model can include entities, their relationships, data flow, tables and more
 For example, within a hierarchal database mode, the data model organizes data in the form of a tree_like structure having parent and child segments
Some of the popular database models include relational models, hierarchical models, flat file models, object oriented models, entity relationship models and network models

Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled
 Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS
 Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system
 Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system
 Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system
 Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system
The very first data model could be flat data_models, where all the data used are to be kept in the same plane
 Earlier data models were not so scientific, hence they were prone to introduce lots of duplication and update anomalies
Entity_Relationship Model is based on the notion of real_world entities and relationships among them
 While formulating real_world scenario into the database model, the ER Model creates entity set, relationship set, general attributes and constraints
ER Model is based on   Entities and their attributes
 Relationships among entities
Entities and their attributes
Relationships among entities
These concepts are explained below
Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes
Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes
 Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain
 For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity
 For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity
 For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity
 Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc
 Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc
Relationship   The logical association among entities is called relationship
 Relationships are mapped with entities in various ways
 Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities
 Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities
 Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities
Mapping cardinalities   one to one
 one to many
 many to one
 many to many
The most popular data model in DBMS is the Relational Model
 It is more scientific a model than others
 This model is based on first_order predicate logic and defines a table as an n_ary relation
The main highlights of this model are   Data is stored in tables called relations
 Relations can be normalized
 Each row in a relation contains a unique value
 Each column in a relation contains values from a same domain

Hierarchical Database model is one of the oldest database models, dating from late 1950s
 This model is like a structure of a tree with the records forming the nodes and fields forming the branches of the tree
 This model is like a structure of a tree with the records forming the nodes and fields forming the branches of the tree
                        
In the hierarchical data model, records are linked with other superior records on which they are dependent and also on the records, which are dependent on them
In the hierarchical data model, records are linked with other superior records on which they are dependent and also on the records, which are dependent on them
 Figure illustrates the structure of a family
 Great grandparent is the root of the structure
 Great grandparent is the root of the structure
 Parents can have many children exhibiting one to many relationships
 The great grandparent record is known as the root of the tree
 The great grandparent record is known as the root of the tree
 The grandparents and children are the nodes or dependents of the root
 In general, a root may have any number of dependents
                            
The different elements  e
g
Another example, of hierarchical  model is shown
 It shows a database of Customer_Loan, here a customer can take multiple loans and there is also a provision of joint loan where more than one person can take a joint loan
 It shows a database of Customer_Loan, here a customer can take multiple loans and there is also a provision of joint loan where more than one person can take a joint loan
 It shows a database of Customer_Loan, here a customer can take multiple loans and there is also a provision of joint loan where more than one person can take a joint loan
 It shows a database of Customer_Loan, here a customer can take multiple loans and there is also a provision of joint loan where more than one person can take a joint loan
 Customer C3 takes two loans L2 of amount 15000 and L3 of amount 25000
                
Sample Database
In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
 The record structure and some sample records for supplier, parts and shipments elements are as given in following tables
                              
                                
 Also we assume that no more than one shipment exists for a given supplier part combination in the shipments table
The tree structure has parts record superior to supplier record
 That is parts form the parent and supplier forms the children
 Each of the four trees figure, consists of one part record occurrence, together with a set of subordinate supplier record occurrences
 There is one supplier record for each supplier of a particular part
 Each supplier occurrence includes the corresponding shipment quantity
                                
For example, supplier S3 supplies 300 quantities of part P2
There are four basic operations Insert, Update, Delete and Retrieve that can be performed on each model
Insert Operation
 It is not possible to insert the information of the supplier e
g
 S4 who does not supply any part
 So, we can say that insert anomaly exists only for those children, which has no corresponding parents
 So, we can say that insert anomaly exists only for those children, which has no corresponding parents
Update Operation
 So, we can say that update anomalies only exist for children not for parent because children may have multiple entries in the database
Delete Operation
 For example
 In hierarchical model, deletion of parent causes the deletion of child records also and if the child occurrence is the only occurrence in the whole database, then the information of child records will also lost with the deletion of parent
 For example
Record Retrieval
Query1
 Find the supplier number for suppliers who supply part P2
Solution
 In order to get this information, first we search the information of parent P2 from database, since parent occurs only once in the whole database, so we obtain only a single record for P2
Algorithm
get  part where PNO P2 
do until no more shipments under this part 
print SNO 
end 
Query2
Solution
 If supplier S2, is found under a part then the corresponding part number is printed, otherwise we go to next part until all the parts are searched for supplier S2
Algorithm
do until no more parts 
get next part 
if found then print PNO 
end 
In above algorithms  next  is interpreted relative the current position 
Since, both the queries involved different logic and are complex, so we can conclude that retrieval operation of this model is complex and asymmetric
Conclusion
 As explained earlier, we can conclude that hierarchical model suffers from the Insertion anomalies, Update anomalies and Deletion anomalies, also the retrieval operation is complex and asymmetric, and thus hierarchical model is not suitable for all the cases
 As explained earlier, we can conclude that hierarchical model suffers from the Insertion anomalies, Update anomalies and Deletion anomalies, also the retrieval operation is complex and asymmetric, and thus hierarchical model is not suitable for all the cases
A collection of field or data items values that provide information on an entity
 Each field has a certain data type such as integer, real or string
It is 1
N relation between two record type
 The record type 1 side is parent record type and one on the N side is called child record type of the PCR type

 Simplicity
 Therefore, it is easier to view data arranged in manner
 This makes this type of database more suitable for the purpose

 The hierarchical database model is a very efficient, one when the database contains a large number of I
 N relationships and when the users require large number of transactions, using data whose relationships are fixed
 N relationships and when the users require large number of transactions, using data whose relationships are fixed
1
 Complexity of Implementation
 The actual implementation of a hierarchical database depends on the physical storage of data
 The actual implementation of a hierarchical database depends on the physical storage of data
 This makes the implementation complicated
2
 Difficulty in Management
 The movement of a data segment from one location to another cause all the accessing programs to be modified making database management a complex affair
3
 Complexity of Programming
 Programming a hierarchical database is relatively complex because the programmers must know the physical path of the data items
4
 Poor Portability
5
 Database Management Problems
 If you make any changes in the database structure of a hierarchical database, then you need to make the necessary changes in all the application programs that access the database
 Thus, maintaining the database and the applications can become very difficult
6
 Lack of structural independence
 Hierarchical database systems use physical storage paths to navigate to the different data segments
 So, the application programs should have a good knowledge of the relevant access paths to access the data
 So, if the physical structure is changed the applications will also have to be modified
7
 Programs Complexity
8
 Operational Anomalies
 As discussed earlier, hierarchical model suffers from the Insert anomalies, Update anomalies and Deletion anomalies, also the retrieval operation is complex and asymmetric, thus hierarchical model is not suitable for all the cases

9
 Implementation Limitation
N format required by the hierarchical model
 The many_to_many  N
N  relationships, which are more common in real life are very difficult to implement in a hierarchical model
 Some data were more naturally modeled with more than one parent per child
 A set consists of an owner record type, a set name, and a member record type
 A member record type can have that role in more than one set  hence the multiparent concept is supported
 A member record type can have that role in more than one set  hence the multiparent concept is supported
An owner record type can also be a member or owner in another set
 The data model is a simple network, and link and intersection record types may exist, as well as sets between them
M relationship, although 1
1 is permitted
 The CODASYL network model is based on mathematical set theory
Network model is a collection data in which records are physically linked through linked lists 
A DBMS is said to be a Network DBMS if the relationships among data in the database are of type many_to_many
A DBMS is said to be a Network DBMS if the relationships among data in the database are of type many_to_many
 The relationship among many_to_many appears in the form of a network
Thus the structure of a network database is extremely complicated because of these many_to_many relationships in which one record can be used as a key of the entire database
Thus the structure of a network database is extremely complicated because of these many_to_many relationships in which one record can be used as a key of the entire database
Thus the structure of a network database is extremely complicated because of these many_to_many relationships in which one record can be used as a key of the entire database
The Relational Model was the first theoretically founded and well thought out Data Model, proposed by EfCodd in 1970, then a researcher at IBM
The Relational Model is a depiction of how each piece of stored information relates to the other stored information
 It shows how tables are linked, what type of links are between tables, what keys are used, what information is referenced between tables
 It s an essential part of developing a normalized database structure to prevent repeat and redundant data storage
The basic idea behind the relational model is that a database consists of a series of unordered tables that can be manipulated using non_procedural operations that return tables
 This model was in vast contrast to the more traditional database theories of the time that were much more complicated, less flexible and dependent on the physical storage methods of the data
 The RELATIONAL database model is based on the Relational Algebra, set theory and predicate logic
 The RELATIONAL database model is based on the Relational Algebra, set theory and predicate logic
It is commonly thought that the word relational in the relational model comes from the fact that you relate together tables in a relational database
 Although this is a convenient way to think of the term, it s not accurate
 Instead, the word relational has its roots in the terminology that Codd used to define the relational model
 Instead, the word relational has its roots in the terminology that Codd used to define the relational model
 The table in Codd s writings was actually referred to as a relation 
In fact, Codd use the terms relations, attributes and tuples where most of us use the more common terms tables, columns and rows, respectively 
 Still, it has a long way to go before it meets all twelve rules completely
An object_oriented database management system is a DBMS that stores data in a logical model that is closely aligned with an application program s object model
An object_oriented database management system is a DBMS that stores data in a logical model that is closely aligned with an application program s object model
 Of course, an OODBMS will have a physical data model optimized for the kinds of logical data model it expects
Object oriented database models have been around since the seventies when the concept of object oriented programming was first explored
 It is only in the last ten or fifteen years that companies are utilizing object oriented DBMSs 
OODBMS should be used when there is a business need, high performance required, and complex data is being used
The result can be a performance increase of ten to one thousand times while writing as little as 40  of the code
