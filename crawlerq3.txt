In our equation y x 7, we have two variables, x and y.
 The variable which we assign the value we call the independent variable, and the other variable is the dependent variable, since it value depends on the independent variable.
 In our example above, x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable.

.
It is common to name a function either for ginstead of y.
 fmeans that we should find the value of our function when x equals 2.

Example.
.
.
f  1   x   x2.
These are all the same function.
 f  1   x   x2.
 f  1   q   q2.
 w  1   A   A2.
 pumpkin  1        2.
A relation is a set of inputs and outputs, often written as ordered pairs .
 We can also represent a relation as a mapping diagram or a graph.
 For example, the relation can be represented as.
In the relation , y is a function of x , because for each input x , there is only one output y .
 x is not a function of y , because the input y   3 has multiple outputs.
 x   1 and x   2 .
Solution.
              .
Example 2  The following relation is not a function.
Solution.
Don t worry about where this relation came from.
  It is just one that we made up for this example.
