Reflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to  know  everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime.

For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a  doSomething  method on it if one exists.
0.874: (you; would like to call; a doSomething method)[enabler=if one exists]
0.869: (you; have; an object of an unknown type)[attrib=you say would]
0.822: (you; to call; a doSomething method)[enabler=if one exists]
0.184: (you; say would for; example)

 Java s static typing system isn t really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called  doSomething  and then call it if you want to.
0.847: (your code; can look at; the object)
0.701: (Java; can look at; the object)

 Performance Overhead.
No extractions found.

Because reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations can not be performed.
0.541: (reflection; involves; types that are dynamically resolved)

 Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non_reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance_sensitive applications.
0.837: (reflective operations; should be avoided in; sections of code)
0.727: (reflective operations; Consequently have should; slower performance)

 Security Restrictions.

Since reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non_reflective code, such as accessing private fields and methods, the use of reflection can result in unexpected side_effects, which may render code dysfunctional and may destroy portability.
