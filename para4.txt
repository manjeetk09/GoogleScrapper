For example, the following is the hierarchical schema of a company database:
In hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree like structure with each record is having one parent record and many children. The main drawback of this model is that, it can have only one to many relationships between nodes.

The hierarchical model was the first database model developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional file system.  Hierarchical databases were predominantly used for transaction processing where the volume of transactions is large and the transaction operations change little over time.  For example, the hierarchical database model was particularly popular with banks, because, the way in which banks process savings transactions seldom varies.

The earliest model was the hierarchical database model, resembling an upside-down tree. Files are related in a parent-child manner, with each parent capable of relating to more than one child, but each child only being related to one parent. Most of you will be familiar with this kind of structure—it’s the way most file systems work. There is usually a root, or top-level, directory that contains various other directories and files. Each subdirectory can then contain more files and directories, and so on. Each file or directory can only exist in one directory itself—it only has one parent. As you can see in the image below A1 is the root directory, and its children are B1 and B2. B1 is a parent to C1, C2, and C3, which in turn has children of its own.

This model, although being a vast improvement on dealing with unrelated files, has some serious disadvantages. It represents one-to-many relationships well (one parent has many children; for example, one company branch has many employees), but it has problems with many-to-many relationships. Relationships such as that between a product file and an orders file are difficult to implement in a hierarchical model. Specifically, an order can contain many products, and a product can appear in many orders. Also, the hierarchal model is not flexible because adding new relationships can result in wholesale changes to the existing structure, which in turn means all existing applications need to change as well. This is not fun when someone has forgotten a table and wants it added to the system shortly before the project is due to launch! And developing the applications is complex because the programmer needs to know the data structure well in order to traverse the model to access the needed data. As you’ve seen in the earlier chapters, when accessing data from two related tables, you only need to know the fields you require from those two tables. In the hierarchical model, you’d need to know the entire chain between the two. For example, to relate data from A1 and D4, you’d need to take the route: A1, B1, C3 and D4.

In figure 1, the node at level 1 is called the root node and the nodes at that has no children are called leaves. For example, node 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Nodes that are children of the same parent are called siblings. For example, nodes 2, 3, 4 are siblings. For any node there is a single path called the hierarchical path from the root node. The nodes along this path are called that nodes ancestors. Similarly for a given node, any node along a path from that node to leaf is called its descendent. For example, suppose we have to find out the hierarchical path of node 10, then it will be 1→2→6→10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1, 2 and 6. The height of tree is the number of levels on the longest hierarchical path from the root to a leaf. The above tree has a height= 4. A tree is said to be balanced if every path from the root node to a leaf has the same length.

Hierarchical database model is a structure of data organized in a tree-like model using parent/child like relationships, therefore there won't be too many relationships. In a hierarchical database, an entity type can be either a parent or a child; under each individual entity is is more multiple entities. Entity types are related to each other using tree mapping, which is represented by one parent with many child relationships. There are also attributes of a specific data recorded under an entity.

The tree like structure can be repeated data, usually with many children under single parent information. Data is a series of records, which have a set of values within it. All of the collected data is recorded in each type. These types are equal to the tables in other database model, and each parent or child is the equivalent of a row or column in a database table. In a hierarchical model, Parent/Child relationships are all link together by certain types of data in a category. The links are mapped in the relationships so it would look like a tree structure with many branches sprouting form many branches. For example, a company will store information about an employee. So in the beginning of the tree will be the employee name. Below the name will be the data of the employee’s number, department, salary, etc. Information such as birthday, children, and age will be stored also.
