Whenever you use a database there is a 99% chance that an index is involved somewhere. The simplest type of index is a sorted listing of the key field. This provides a fast lookup because you can use a binary search to locate any item without having to look at each one in turn.

Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

In this chapter we will discuss tree data structures, like trees and graphs. The abilities of these data structures are really important for the modern programming. Each of this data structures is used for building a model of real life problems, which are efficiently solved using this model. We will explain what tree data structures are and will review their main advantages and disadvantages. We will present example implementations and problems showing their practical usage. We will focus on binary trees, binary search trees and self-balancing binary search tree. We will explain what graph is, the types of graphs, how to represent a graph in the memory (graph implementation) and where graphs are used in our life and in the computer technologies. We will see where in .NET Framework self-balancing binary search trees are implemented and how to use them.

In linear data structure, data is organized in sequential order and in non-linear data structure, data is organized in random order. Tree is a very popular data structure used in wide range of applications. A tree data structure can be defined as follows...

Singly linked lists An example of one of the simplest types of graphs is a singly linked list! Now we can start to see the power of the graph data structure, as it can represent very complicated relationships, but also something as simple as a list.



























A binary tree is a special kind of tree, one in which all nodes have at most two children. For a given node in a binary tree, the first child is referred to as the left child, while the second child is referred to as the right child. Figure 2 depicts two binary trees.
