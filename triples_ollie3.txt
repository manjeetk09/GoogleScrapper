Because data structures are higher_level abstractions, they present to us operations on groups of data, such as adding an item to a list, or looking up the highest_priority item in a queue.
0.881: (they; present to; operations)
0.842: (higher_level abstractions; present to; operations)
0.622: (an item; be adding to; a list)

 When a data structure provides operations, we can call the data structure an abstract data type .
0.668: (a data structure; provides; operations)

 Abstract data types can minimize dependencies in your code, which is important when your code needs to be changed.
0.808: (Abstract data types; can minimize; dependencies)

 Because you are abstracted away from lower_level details, some of the higher_level commonalities one data structure shares with a different data structure can be used to replace one with the other.
0.645: (one; to be replace with; the other)
0.564: (one data structure shares; can be used in; the higher_level commonalities)

In computer science, an abstract data type is a mathematical model for data types where a data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.

For example, an abstract stack, which is a last_in_first_out structure, could be defined by three operations: push, that inserts a data item onto the stack; pop, that removes a data item from it; and peek or top, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal.

0.69: (an abstract stack which is a last_in_first_out structure; could be defined push , that inserts a data item onto the stack ; pop , that removes a data item from it ; and peek or top , that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal by; three operations)

 An abstract queue, which is a first_in_first_out structure, would also have three operations: enqueue, that inserts a data item into the queue; dequeue, that removes the first data item from it; and front, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue.
0.838: (An abstract queue which is a first_in_first_out structure; would also have three operations; enqueue , that inserts a data item into the queue ; dequeue , that removes the first data item from it ; and front , that accesses and serves the first data item)
0.485: (An abstract queue which is a first_in_first_out structure; be enqueue , that inserts a data item into the queue ; dequeue , that removes the first data item from it ; and front , that accesses and serves the first data item in; the queue)
0.43: (An abstract queue which is a first_in_first_out structure; would also have enqueue , that inserts a data item into the queue ; dequeue , that removes the first data item from it ; and front , that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue; three operations)

 There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet.
0.598: (each pop; always returns; the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet)

 When analyzing the efficiency of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.
0.894: (many data items; have been pushed into; the stack)
0.65: (the stack; have uses a constant amount of storage for; each element)
0.648: (the stack; have uses; a constant amount of storage)
0.606: (all operations; take the same time; no matter)
0.289: (all operations; take no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack , and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element; the same time)
