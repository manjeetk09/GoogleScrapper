The emerging field of  auditory display  uses sound to convey more detailed information.
0.807: (The emerging field of auditory display; uses; sound)
0.782: (The emerging field of auditory display; uses sound to convey; detailed information)

 For debugging purposes, this requires translating arbitrary data into sound through a process called  sonification  or  audification.
0.707: (arbitrary data; be translating into; sound)
0.705: (arbitrary data; be translating through; a process called sonification or audification)

  Through this process, a language of sound is created.
0.754: (a language of sound; is created through; this process)

 What does this mean  While generating different notes to indicate that a variable   5 or 47 may be less useful, consider using two different notes to indicate bidirectional communications between two programs.
0.654: (a variable 5 or 47; may be; useful)

 The rhythm between the notes conveys how often communications occur, and the relative sizes of the payloads of each message.
0.84: (communications; be the relative sizes of; the payloads of each message)[attrib=The rhythm conveys]

 Music and rhythm are innate tools that in this case would allow us to avoid sifting through pages and pages of interprocessor messaging.

Tools for Debugging.

 Each of the above debugging approaches can be supplemented with debugging tools.

 For debugging we can apply wide variety of debugging tools such as debugging compilers, dynamic debugging aids, automatic test case generators, memory dumps and cross reference maps.

Classification of different types of test tools according to the test process activities.
No extractions found.

 The tools are grouped by the testing activities or areas that are supported by a set of tools, for example, tools that support management activities, tools to support static testing, etc.
0.756: (The tools; are grouped tools that support management activities , tools to support static testing , etc by; the testing activities or areas that are supported by a)
0.674: (The tools; are grouped; tools that support management activities to support static testing)
0.249: (The tools; are grouped tools that support management activities , tools to support static testing , etc for; example)

Other example of the probe effect is when a debugging tool tries to find a particular defect.
0.772: (a debugging tool; tries to find; a particular defect)

 If the code is run with the debugger, then the bug disappears  it only re_appears when the debugger is turned off, hence making it very difficult to find.
0.655: (the bug; disappears; it)
0.198: (the code; is run then with; the debugger)

 These are sometimes known as  Heizenbugs  .
