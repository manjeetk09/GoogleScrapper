There are four built_in data structures in Python _ list, tuple, dictionary and set.
No extractions found.

 We will see how to use each of them and how they make life easier for us.

The list of items should be enclosed in square brackets so that Python understands that you are specifying a list.
0.9: (The list of items; should be enclosed in; square brackets)
0.612: (you; are specifying; a list)[attrib=Python so understands]

 Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list.
0.72: (you; Once have created; a list)

 Since we can add and remove items, we say that a list is a mutable data type i.
0.527: (a list; is; a mutable data type i)
