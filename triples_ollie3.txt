Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.
0.711: (a function; be inferring from; labeled training data)
0.704: (Supervised learning; is; the machine)

 The training data consist of a set of training examples.
0.892: (The training data; consist of; a set of training examples)

 In supervised learning  each example is a pair consisting of an input object  typically a vector  and a desired output value  also called the supervisory signal .
0.806: (a vector and a desired output value; also called; the supervisory signal)
0.792: (a pair; consisting of; an input object typically a vector and a desired output value also called the supervisory signal)
0.752: (each example; is; a pair consisting of an input object)
0.746: (each example; is a pair in; supervised learning)

 A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function  which can be used for mapping new examples.
0.812: (A supervised learning algorithm analyzes; produces; an inferred function which can be used for mapping new examples)

 An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.
0.861: (An optimal scenario; will allow for; the algorithm)
0.788: (An optimal scenario; to correctly determine; the class labels)
0.693: (An optimal scenario; will allow to correctly determine; the class labels)

 This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a  reasonable  way  see inductive bias .
0.854: (the learning algorithm; to generalize from; the training data)
0.82: (the learning algorithm; to generalize to; unseen situations)
0.756: (the learning algorithm; to generalize in; a reasonable way)

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset  called the training dataset  to make predictions.
0.935: (Supervised learning; is a type of; machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset)
0.894: (a type of machine learning algorithm; called; the training dataset to make predictions)
0.768: (Supervised learning; is; a type of machine learning algorithm)
0.62: (a known dataset; be uses by; machine learning algorithm)

 The training dataset includes input data and response values.
0.782: (The training dataset; includes; input data and response values)

 From it  the supervised learning algorithm seeks to build a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset.
0.803: (the supervised learning algorithm; seeks to build; a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset)
0.708: (predictions of the response values; can be make for; a new dataset)

 A test dataset is often used to validate the model.
0.761: (A test dataset; to validate; the model)

 Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.
0.762: (larger training datasets; often yield; models)
