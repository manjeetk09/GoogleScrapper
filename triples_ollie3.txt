In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables.
0.936: (a plane real algebraic curve; is the set of; points)
0.932: (whose coordinates; are zeros of; some polynomial)
0.906: (whose coordinates; are zeros of some polynomial in; two variables)
0.794: (a plane real algebraic curve; is; the set of points)
0.746: (a plane real algebraic curve; is the set of points in; mathematics)

 More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.

Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs connected by some points sometimes called  remarkable points .
0.87: (Every algebraic curve; may be uniquely decomposed remarkable points into; a finite number of smooth monotone arcs)
0.655: (smooth monotone arcs; be connected by; some points)
0.619: (Every algebraic curve; may be uniquely decomposed; remarkable points)

 A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis.
0.953: (A smooth monotone arc; is the graph of; a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis)
0.736: (A smooth monotone arc; is; the graph of a smooth function)
0.53: (a smooth function which is defined; be monotone on; an open interval of the x_axis)

 In each direction, an arc is either unbounded or has an end point which is either a singular point or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.
0.653: (an arc; is; unbounded)
0.48: (an arc; is unbounded in; each direction)

This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the  complete  curve.
0.926: (the affine curve; is a part of; the projective curve that is large enough to well define the complete curve)
0.621: (the affine curve; is; a part of the projective curve)

 This point of view is commonly expressed by calling  points at infinity  of the affine curve the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.
0.437: (points; calling the points of the projective completion that do not belong to be the affine part at; infinity of the affine curve)
0.436: (the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part; be calling points at; infinity of the affine curve)

There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
No extractions found.

 Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0.564: (the graphs; be produces by; its own type of function)

 They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0.796: (you; can get; an idea what a graph might look like)

 The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
No extractions found.

These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves.
0.821: (These functions; produce more interesting graphs with; more curves)
0.793: (These functions; produce; interesting graphs)

 The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.

Algebra is all about graphing relationships, and the curve is one of the most basic shapes used.
0.754: (Algebra; is; all about graphing relationships , and the curve)
0.724: (all about graphing relationships , and the curve; is; one of the most basic shapes)

 Here s a look at eight of the most frequently used graphs.

The following table lists the names of algebraic curves of a given degree.
No extractions found.

Curves that can be given in implicit form as f 0, where f is a polynomial, are called algebraic.
0.443: (f; is; a polynomial)

 The degree of f is called the degree or order of the curve.
0.818: (The degree of f; is called; the degree or order of the curve)
0.646: (The degree of f; be the degree of; the curve)

 Thus conics are algebraic curves of degree two.
0.908: (conics; Thus are algebraic curves of; degree two)

 Curves of degree three already have a great variety of shapes, and only a few common ones will be given here.
0.661: (Curves of degree three; already have will; a great variety of shapes)

More generally, any curve of degree three with equation y f, where f is a polynomial, is symmetric with respect to the x_axis and asymptotic to the line x x.
0.79: (any curve of degree three; More generally is symmetric with; respect to the x_axis and asymptotic)
0.636: (any curve of degree three; More generally is; symmetric)
0.516: (f; is; a polynomial)
0.383: (symmetric; be any curve of; degree three)

 In addition to the cissoid, the following particular cases are important.
