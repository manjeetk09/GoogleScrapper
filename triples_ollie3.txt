In our equation y x 7, we have two variables, x and y.
0.604: (we; have; two variables)
0.302: (we; have two variables , x and y in; our equation y x 7)

 The variable which we assign the value we call the independent variable, and the other variable is the dependent variable, since it value depends on the independent variable.
0.847: (value; depends on; the independent variable)
0.748: (The variable which we assign the value we call the independent variable , and the other variable; is; the dependent variable)
0.386: (we; which assign; the value we call the independent variable)

 In our example above, x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable.
0.457: (x; is; the independent variable)

A relation is a set of inputs and outputs, often written as ordered pairs .
0.955: (A relation; is a set of; inputs and outputs , often written as ordered pairs)
0.736: (A relation; is; a set of inputs)
0.692: (inputs and outputs; be often written as; ordered pairs)

 We can also represent a relation as a mapping diagram or a graph.
0.768: (We; can also represent a relation as; a mapping diagram or a graph)
0.723: (We; can also represent; a relation)
0.708: (a relation; can be also represent as; a mapping diagram or a graph)

 For example, the relation can be represented as.
0.46: (the relation; can be represented as for; example)

In the relation , y is a function of x , because for each input x , there is only one output y .
0.813: (y; is a function of; x)
0.738: (y; is a function of x for; each input)
0.568: (y; is a function of x in; the relation)
0.539: (y; is; a function of x)

 x is not a function of y , because the input y   3 has multiple outputs.
0.822: (x; is not a function of; y)[enabler=because the input y 3 has multiple outputs]
0.626: (the input y 3; has; multiple outputs)
0.539: (x; is; not a function of y)
