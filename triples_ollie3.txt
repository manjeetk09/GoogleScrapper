AMP stands for Asymmetric Multi_Processing  SMP means Symmetric Multi_Processing.
0.673: (AMP; stands for; Asymmetric Multi_Processing SMP)

 These terms are not at all transparent.
0.83: (These terms; are not at; all transparent)

 In seeking a means to clarify, I thought I would check Wikipedia and looked up  AMP .
0.605: (I; would check; Wikipedia)[attrib=I thought]

 From the disambiguation page, I found the relevant article.
0.721: (I; found; the relevant article)
0.601: (I; found the relevant article from; the disambiguation page)
0.565: (the relevant article; be found from; the disambiguation page)

 Well, I say  relevant , but it really does not cover the topic as we see it today.
0.711: (it; really does not cover; the topic)[enabler=as we see it today]
0.278: (we; see today; it)

 It talks about historical uses of multiple CPUs and dismisses it to history.

 So, I will try to advance definitions.

Asymmetric multiprocessing was the only method for handling multiple CPUs before symmetric multiprocessing was available.
0.748: (Asymmetric multiprocessing; was; the only method)
0.706: (the only method; was; available)
0.622: (multiple CPUs; be handling before; symmetric multiprocessing)

 It has also been used to provide less expensive options on systems where SMP was available.
0.698: (It; to provide; less expensive options)
0.542: (SMP; was; available)

 Additionally, AMP is used in applications that are dedicated, such as embedded systems, when individual processors can be dedicated to specific tasks at design time.

0.709: (AMP; Additionally is used in; applications that are dedicated)[enabler=when individual processors can be dedicated to specific tasks at design time]

 In an asymmetric multiprocessing system, not all CPUs are treated equally  for example, a system might only allow one CPU to execute operating system code or might only allow one CPU to perform I O operations.
0.683: (not all CPUs; are treated equally in; an asymmetric multiprocessing system)
0.654: (one CPU; to execute; operating system code)

 Other AMP systems would allow any CPU to execute operating system code and perform I O operations, so that they were symmetric with regard to processor roles, but attached some or all peripherals to particular CPUs, so that they were asymmetric with regard to peripheral attachment.

Asymmetric multiprocessing    In asymmetric multiprocessing the program tasks are strictly divided by type between processors and typically, each processor has its own memory address space.
0.925: (the program tasks; are strictly divided by; type)
0.754: (the program tasks; are strictly divided in; asymmetric)
0.567: (each processor; typically has; its own memory address space)

  These features make asymmetric multiprocessing difficult to implement.

 Symmetric multiprocessing Symmetric multiprocessing is the most common configuration of multiple processors.

 A typical SMP configuration has the following items.

        It has multiple processors and exactly one of everything else.

        The processors are symmetric, that is, they can do anything the others can.
0.825: (they; can do; anything the others can)
0.762: (symmetric; can do; anything the others can)

  Each can look at or alter any element of memory, and each can do any kind of I O.

 in a tightly_coupled system, the delay experienced when a message is sent from one computer to another is short, and data rate is high  that is, the number of bits per second that can be transferred is large.

 In a loosely_coupled system, the opposite is true.

 the intermachine message delay is large and the data rate is low.

 For example, two CPU chips on the same printed circuit board and connected by wires etched onto the board are likely to be tightly coupled, whereas two computers connected by a 2400 bit sec modem over the telephone system are certain to be loosely coupled.

Or, different OSs may reside on the two cores.

 For example, if two previously separate processors are being collapsed onto one dual_core device, different OSs may reside on the two cores.
