A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.
0.752: (A hash function; is; any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size)

 The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.
0.9: (The values returned by a hash function; are called hash; values)
0.763: (The values; be returned by; a hash function)

 One use is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup.
0.817: (a hash table; be widely used in; computer software)
0.793: (a hash table; be widely used for; rapid data lookup)
0.667: (One use; is; a data structure)

 Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file.
0.661: (duplicated records; be detecting in; a large file)

 An example is finding similar stretches in DNA sequences.
0.692: (An example; is finding; similar stretches)

 They are also useful in cryptography.
0.873: (They; are also useful in; cryptography)

 A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it by knowing the stored hash value.
0.685: (it; is deliberately; difficult)
0.093: (the input data; is; unknown)

 This is used for assuring integrity of transmitted data, and is the building block for HMACs, which provide message authentication.

A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later.
0.939: (A hash table; is a collection of; items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later)
0.736: (A hash table; is; a collection of items)
0.403: (it; to find later; them)

 Each position of the hash table, often called a slot, can hold an item and is named by an integer value starting at 0.
0.787: (Each position of the hash table often called a slot; can is named by; an integer value starting at 0.)
0.741: (Each position of the hash table often called a slot; can hold; an item)
0.552: (an integer value; starting at; 0.)

 For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1, a slot named 2, and so on.
0.752: (a slot; be named 0,; a slot named 1)
0.729: (we; will have; a slot named 0, a slot)
0.2: (a slot named 0, a slot; will be have for; example)
0.109: (we; will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1 for; example)

 Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty.
0.755: (the hash table; Initially contains; no items)[enabler=so every slot is empty]
0.598: (every slot; is; empty)

 We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value None.
0.723: (We; can implement; a hash table)
0.714: (a list; be using with; each element initialized to the special Python value None)
0.641: (each element; be initialized to; the special Python value None)

 Figure 4 shows a hash table of size  .
0.798: (Figure 4; shows; a hash table of size)

 In other words, there are m slots in the table, named 0 through 10.
0.625: (m slots named 0 through 10; are in; other words)

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.

 The hash function generates a hash code by operating on two blocks of fixed_length binary data.

What is a good Hash function  I saw a lot of hash function and applications in my data structures courses in college, but I mostly got that it s pretty hard to make a good hash function.
