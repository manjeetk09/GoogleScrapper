A universal hashing scheme is a randomized algorithm that selects a hashing function h among a family of such functions, in such a way that the probability of a collision of any two distinct keys is 1 n, where n is the number of distinct hash values desired independently of the two keys.
0.816: (n; is the number of; distinct hash values)
0.802: (A universal hashing scheme; is; a randomized algorithm that selects a hashing function h among a family of such functions , in such a way that the probability of a collision of any two distinct keys is 1 n , where n is the number of distinct hash values desired independently of the two keys)

 Universal hashing ensures that the hash function application will behave as well as if it were using a random function, for any distribution of the input data.

 It will, however, have more collisions than perfect hashing and may require more operations than a special_purpose hash function.

A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later.
0.939: (A hash table; is a collection of; items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later)
0.736: (A hash table; is; a collection of items)
0.403: (it; to find later; them)

 Each position of the hash table, often called a slot, can hold an item and is named by an integer value starting at 0.
0.787: (Each position of the hash table often called a slot; can is named by; an integer value starting at 0.)
0.741: (Each position of the hash table often called a slot; can hold; an item)
0.552: (an integer value; starting at; 0.)

 For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1, a slot named 2, and so on.
0.752: (a slot; be named 0,; a slot named 1)
0.729: (we; will have; a slot named 0, a slot)
0.2: (a slot named 0, a slot; will be have for; example)
0.109: (we; will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1 for; example)

 Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty.
0.755: (the hash table; Initially contains; no items)[enabler=so every slot is empty]
0.598: (every slot; is; empty)

 We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value None.
0.723: (We; can implement; a hash table)
0.714: (a list; be using with; each element initialized to the special Python value None)
0.641: (each element; be initialized to; the special Python value None)

 Figure 4 shows a hash table of size  .
0.798: (Figure 4; shows; a hash table of size)

 In other words, there are m slots in the table, named 0 through 10.

 The hash function generates a hash code by operating on two blocks of fixed_length binary data.

What is a good Hash function  I saw a lot of hash function and applications in my data structures courses in college, but I mostly got that it s pretty hard to make a good hash function.

For doing  normal  hash table lookups on basically any kind of data _ this one by Paul Hsieh is the best I ve ever used.

I know there are things like SHA_256 and such, but these algorithms are designed to be secure, which usually means they are slower than algorithms that are less unique.

 I want a hash algorithm designed to be fast, yet remain fairly unique to avoid collisions.

The other subjective measure is how randomly distributed the hashes are.

 Mapping the resulting HashTables shows how evenly the data is distributed.

Choosing a good hashing function, h, is essential for hash_table based searching.
No extractions found.

 h should distribute the elements of our collection as uniformly as possible to the  slots  of the hash table.
0.666: (h; should distribute; the elements of our collection)

 The key criterion is that there should be a minimum number of collisions.
