0;The MD5 function is a cryptographic algorithm that takes an input of arbitrary length and produces a message digest that is 128 bits long.
0; The digest is sometimes also called the  hash  or  fingerprint  of the input.
0; MD5 is used in many situations where a potentially long message needs to be processed and or compared quickly.
0; The most common application is the creation and verification of digital signatures.
0;The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128_bit hash value.
0; Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.
0; It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.

0;The MD5 hashing algorithm is a one_way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length as input and returns as output a fixed_length digest value to be used for authenticating the original message.

0;In the diagram, the one_way compression function is denoted by f, and transforms two fixed length inputs to an output of the same size as one of the inputs.
0; The algorithm starts with an initial value, the initialization vector .
0; The IV is a fixed value .
0; For each message block, the compression function f takes the result so far, combines it with the message block, and produces an intermediate result.
0; The last block is padded with zeros as needed and bits representing the length of the entire message are appended.

0;  Though MD5 is widely known, it is not a very secure hash.
0; There exists many attacks such as rainbow table attack.

0; Further, there is also a chosen_prefix collision attack that can produce a collision for two inputs with specified prefixes within hours, using off_the_shelf computing hardware .
0; The ability to find collisions has been greatly aided by the use of off_the_shelf GPUs.

0;MD5 was most popular and widely used hash function for quite some years.
0; The MD family comprises of hash functions MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6.
0; It was adopted as Internet Standard RFC 1321.
0; It is a 128_bit hash function.
0; MD5 digests have been widely used in the software world to provide assurance about integrity of transferred file.
0; For example, file servers often provide a pre_computed MD5 checksum for the files, so that a user can compare the checksum of the downloaded file to it.
0; In 2004, collisions were found in MD5.
0; An analytical attack was reported to be successful only in an hour by using computer cluster.
0; This collision attack resulted in compromised MD5 and hence it is no longer recommended for use.

0;MD5 which stands for Message Digest algorithm 5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function that was invented by Ronald Rivest in 1991.
0; The idea behind this algorithm is to take up a random data as an input and generate a fixed size  hash value  as the output.
0; The input data can be of any size or length, but the output  hash value  size is always fixed.
0; Here is an example of MD5 Hash function at work.
