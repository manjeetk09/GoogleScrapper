1;A universal hashing scheme is a randomized algorithm that selects a hashing function h among a family of such functions, in such a way that the probability of a collision of any two distinct keys is 1 n, where n is the number of distinct hash values desired independently of the two keys.
1; Universal hashing ensures that the hash function application will behave as well as if it were using a random function, for any distribution of the input data.
1; It will, however, have more collisions than perfect hashing and may require more operations than a special_purpose hash function.

0;A hash table is a collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make it easy to find them later.
0; Each position of the hash table, often called a slot, can hold an item and is named by an integer value starting at 0.
0; For example, we will have a slot named 0, a slot named 1, a slot named 2, and so on.
0; Initially, the hash table contains no items so every slot is empty.
0; We can implement a hash table by using a list with each element initialized to the special Python value None.
0; Figure 4 shows a hash table of size  .
0; In other words, there are m slots in the table, named 0 through 10.

0;Understand the difference between hash function and algorithm correctly.
0; The hash function generates a hash code by operating on two blocks of fixed_length binary data.
0;What is a good Hash function  I saw a lot of hash function and applications in my data structures courses in college, but I mostly got that it s pretty hard to make a good hash function.
0; As a rule of thumb to avoid collisions my professor said that.
0;For doing  normal  hash table lookups on basically any kind of data _ this one by Paul Hsieh is the best I ve ever used.
0;I know there are things like SHA_256 and such, but these algorithms are designed to be secure, which usually means they are slower than algorithms that are less unique.
0; I want a hash algorithm designed to be fast, yet remain fairly unique to avoid collisions.
0;The other subjective measure is how randomly distributed the hashes are.
0; Mapping the resulting HashTables shows how evenly the data is distributed.
0; All the hash functions show good distribution when mapping the table linearly.
0;Choosing a good hashing function, h, is essential for hash_table based searching.
0; h should distribute the elements of our collection as uniformly as possible to the  slots  of the hash table.
0; The key criterion is that there should be a minimum number of collisions.
