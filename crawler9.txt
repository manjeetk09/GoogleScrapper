1;A flat database is a simple database system in which each database is represented as a single table in which all of the records are stored as single rows of data, which are separated by delimiters such as tabs or commas.
1; The table is usually stored and physically represented as a simple text file.
1; Because of the limitations of flat databases, they are not unsuitable for most software applications in which there is a need to represent and store complex business relationships.
1; However, some application developers still use flat files in order to reduce the cost and complexity of integrating a relational database.
1; Flat databases are also sometimes referred to as flat_file databases.

0;Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a non_relational database.
0; A good example of a flat file is a single text_only file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter.

0;The flat model is the earliest, simplest data model.
0; It simply lists all the data in a single table, consisting of columns and rows.
0; In order to access or manipulate the data, the computer has to read the entire flat file into memory, which makes this model inefficient for all but the smallest data sets.
