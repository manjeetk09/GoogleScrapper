0;It looks like this.
0;when x is less than 2, it gives x2,.
0;when x is exactly 2 it gives 6.
0;when x is more than 2 and less than or equal to 6 it gives the line 10_x.
0;You may be asked to write a piecewise function, given a graph.
0;  Now that we know what piecewise functions are all about, it s not that bad  To review how to obtain equations from linear graphs, see Obtaining the Equations of a Line, and from quadratics, see Finding a Quadratic Equation from Points or a Graph.
0; Here are the graphs, with explanations on how to derive their piecewise equations.
0;Some Simple Examples.
0;Besides evaluating limits, you can do operations such as computing derivatives, integrating, and solving differential equations with piecewise functions.
0; Examples of solving DEs will be illustrated later.
0; Using the same function, f, find its piecewise derivative.
