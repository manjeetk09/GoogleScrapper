1;A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
1; General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on.
1; Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.
1; In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms.

0;Data structure, way in which data are stored for efficient search and retrieval.
0; Different data structures are suited for different problems.
0; Some data structures are useful for simple general problems, such as retrieving data that has been stored with a specific identifier.
0; For example, an online dictionary can be structured so that it can retrieve the definition of a word.
0; On the other hand, specialized data structures have been devised to solve complex specific search problems.
