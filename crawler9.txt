0;Provide concepts that are close to the way people perceive data to present the data.
0; A typical example of this type is the entity relationship model which uses main concepts like entities, attributes, relationships.
0; An entity represents a real_world object such as an employee, a project.
0; An entity has some attributes which represents properties of entity such as employee s name, address, birthdate.
0; A relationship represents an association among entities, for example an employee works on many projects.
0; The relationship exists between employee and project.

0;Database systems can be based on different data models or database models respectively.
0; A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database.
0; Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively.
0; The most often used data models are.

0;A Database model defines the logical design of data.
0; The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
0; Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
0; They are, Hierarchical Model.

0;A model is a representation of reality,  real world  objects and events, associations.
0; It is an abstraction that concentrates on the essential, inherent aspects an organization and ignores the accidental properties.
0; A data model represents the organization itself.
0; It should provide the basic concepts and notations that will allow database designers and end users unambiguously and accurately to communicate their understanding of the organizational data.
0;Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled.
0; Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS.
0; Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.
0;Entity_Relationship Model is based on the notion of real_world entities and relationships among them.
0; While formulating real_world scenario into the database model, the ER Model creates entity set, relationship set, general attributes and constraints.
