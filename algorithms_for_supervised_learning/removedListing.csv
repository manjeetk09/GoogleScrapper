algorithms for supervised learning;https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/common-machine-learning-algorithms/;Benjamin says  December 5, 2015 at 7 00 pm This is a great resource overall and surely the product of a lot of work  Just a note as I go through this, your comment on Logistic Regression not actually being regression is in fact wrong  It maps outputs to a continuous variable bound between 0 and 1 that we regard as probability  it makes classification easy but that is still an extra step that requires the choice of a threshold which is not the main aim of Logistic Regression  As a matter of fact it falls under the umbrella of Generalized Libear Models as the glm R package hints it in your code example  I thought this was interesting to note so as not to forget that logistic regression output is richer than 0 or 1  Thanks for the great article overall .;logistic_regression;0.6969696969690908;0.0037735849056603774;0.45945945945945943;1.1602027413342106;0.7071067811865475;0;Wed Jun 28 04:14:38 IST 2017;logistic_regression;typeOf;linear_classifier;typeOf;supervised_learning
