Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way.
 Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage.
 For example, we have data player s name  Virat  and age 26.
 Here  Virat  is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type.

NOTE.
 Before going deep into data structure, you should have a good knowledge of programming either in C or in C   or Java.

Some properties of abstract data types.
A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.
In these data structures each tree node compares a bit slice of key values.

Some properties of abstract data types.
Double_ended queue.
.
.
Simply you can group various built_in data types into a structure.
A structure in C is a collection of items of different types  You can think of a structure as a  record  is in Pascal or a class in Java without methods .
Structures, or structs, are very useful in creating data structures larger and more complex than the ones we have discussed so far .
Simply you can group various built_in data types into a structure .
Object conepts was derived from Structure concept  You can achieve few object oriented goals using C structure but it is very complex .
