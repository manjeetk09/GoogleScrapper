 Different types have emerged since that time.
0.831: (Different types; have emerged since; that time)

 In one of the earliest and most common types, Reed_Solomon, the data can be reconstructed using any combination of  k  symbols, or pieces of data, even if  m  symbols are lost or unavailable.

 For example, in EC 10 16, six drives, nodes or geographic locations could be lost or unavailable, and the original file would still be recoverable.
