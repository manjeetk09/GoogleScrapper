A  crash  happens when the program cannot normally continue because of a programming bug.

 For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory.

 When the program  crashes  or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the position in the original code if it is a source_level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly now seen in integrated development environments.

What does a debugging program do and how is it useful  These questions are better explained by example, but to give a quick answer, a debugging program allows you to monitor control of a program during program execution.
0.885: (you; to monitor; control of a program)
0.875: (you; to monitor control of a program during; program execution)
0.819: (These questions; are explained by; example)

 What does that mean  Well, let s give a quick example.
0.727: (s; give; a quick example)

 Using the debug program you can tell the program to execute until a specific statement is reached  upon reaching this statement the debugger allows you to look at and change values of different variables in the program and also the registers used by the PC .

Using print statements for debugging a program is often not adequate or convenient.

 For example, the programmer may want to change the values of certain variables after observing the execution of the program till some point.
0.846: (the programmer; may want to change; the values of certain variables)

 For a large program it may be difficult to go back to the source program, make the necessary changes and rerun the program.

0.419: (it; may rerun; the program)
0.343: (it; may make; the necessary changes)

 Again, if such print statements are placed inside loops, it will produce output everytime the loop is executed though the programmer may be interested in only certain iterations of the loop.

0.398: (it; Again will produce; output)

 To overcome several such drawbacks of debugging by inserting extra statements in the program, there are a kind of tool called debugger that helps in debugging programs by giving the programmer some control over the execution of the program and some means of examining and modifying different program variables during runtime.

0.674: (different program variables; be examining during; runtime)
