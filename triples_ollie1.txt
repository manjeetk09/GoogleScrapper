The mathematical concept of a function expresses the intuitive idea that one quantity completely determines another quantity.
0.807: (The mathematical concept of a function; expresses; the intuitive idea)
0.679: (one quantity; completely determines; another quantity)

 An equation will be a function if for any x in the domain of the equation, there is exactly one value of y.
0.837: (An equation; will be; a function if for any x in the domain of the equation , there is exactly one value of y)

 More formally, a function is defined a type of relation which has only one output value with respect any permissible input value.
0.724: (a function; More formally is defined; a type of relation)
0.691: (relation; has only one output value with; respect)
0.548: (only one output value; be has by; relation)

 The argument and the value may be real numbers, but they can also be elements from any given sets.
0.846: (they; can also be; elements)
0.655: (The argument and the value; may be; real numbers)
0.644: (they; be elements from; any given sets)

 the domain, the co_domain of the function and all the assigned values are in the Range of the function.
0.865: (the assigned values; are in; the Range of the function)
0.502: (the assigned values; be the co domain of; the function)

 It is important how we assign the values to each element of the domain.
0.799: (we; assign the values to; each element of the domain)
0.691: (we; assign; the values)
0.554: (It; is; important)

A polynomial or algebraic function is a function which can be expressed in the following form.
0.752: (A polynomial or algebraic function; is; a function which can be expressed in the following form)

  f  a_ n x  n    a_ n _ 1 x  n _ 1   .
0.59: (1 x n;  ; 1)
0.394: (f; a ; n x)

   a_ 2 x  2    a_ 1 x  1    a_ 0  .

The graphs that these types of functions produce vary depending on the power.
No extractions found.

 If the power is positive, the graph changes direction based on the number of the power.
0.842: (the graph changes direction; be based on; the number of the power)
0.093: (the power; is; positive)

 If the power is even, the graph will have both edges going in the same direction.
0.845: (the graph; will have; both edges going in the same direction)[enabler=If the power is even]
0.729: (both edges; going in; the same direction)

 If the power is odd, the graph will have one edge going up and another going down.
0.091: (the power; is; odd)

 If the power is negative, it will have two parts.
0.678: (it; will have; two parts)[enabler=If the power is negative]
0.093: (the power; is; negative)

 Each part will avoid the x 0 line because that will cause division by zero.
0.808: (Each part; will avoid; the x 0 line)[enabler=because that will cause division by zero]
0.708: (division; will be cause by; zero)

 When the power is a fraction, the graph goes up at x 0 and then when y is positive, it starts curving towards the x_axis.
0.698: (a fraction; goes up then at; x 0)[enabler=when y is positive]
0.698: (the graph; goes up then at; x 0)[enabler=when y is positive]
0.67: (it; starts curving towards; the x_axis)
0.653: (the power; is; a fraction)
0.457: (y; is; positive)
