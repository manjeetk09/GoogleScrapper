0.655: (samples; are triggered in; implict sampling)

 Consider the continuous time sinusoidal signal and its two sided magnitude spectrum depicted in Figure 2.

 There are three explicit sampling techniques natural sampling  instantaneous sampling  and ideal sampling that can be used to sample such a signal.
No extractions found.

 The results produced by these techniques  and the corresponding impacts on the signal s spectrum are compared in Key Concept 2.

The definition of proper sampling is quite simple.

 Suppose you sample a continuous signal in some manner.
0.844: (you; be sample a continuous signal in; some manner)

 If you can exactly reconstruct the analog signal from the samples  you must have done the sampling properly.
0.658: (the analog signal; can be exactly reconstruct from; the samples)
0.582: (you; must have done properly; the sampling)[enabler=If you can exactly reconstruct the analog signal from the samples]
0.232: (you; can exactly reconstruct the analog signal from; the samples)
0.23: (you; can exactly reconstruct; the analog signal)

 Even if the sampled data appears confusing or incomplete  the key information has been captured if you can reverse the process.
0.205: (you; can reverse; the process)
0.071: (the sampled data; Even appears; confusing or incomplete)
