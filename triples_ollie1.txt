There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
No extractions found.

 Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0.564: (the graphs; be produces by; its own type of function)

 They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0.796: (you; can get; an idea what a graph might look like)

 The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
