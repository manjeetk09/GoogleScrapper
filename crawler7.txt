0;Find the derivatives of various functions using different methods and rules.
0; Several Examples with detailed solutions are presented.
0; More exercises with answers are at the end of this page.
0;An algebraic function is a function that can be written using a finite number of the basic operations of arithmetic  i.
0;e.
0;, addition, multiplication, and exponentiation .
0; In order to take the derivative of these functions, we will need the power rule.
0;Calculus.
0; Differentiation.
0; Examples _ Derivative of Algebraic functions.
0;In the first section of this chapter we saw the definition of the derivative and we computed a couple of derivatives using the definition.
0;  As we saw in those examples there was a fair amount of work involved in computing the limits and the functions that we worked with were not terribly complicated.

0;For more complex functions using the definition of the derivative would be an almost impossible task.
0;  Luckily for us we won t have to use the definition terribly often.
0;  We will have to use it on occasion, however we have a large collection of formulas and properties that we can use to simplify our life considerably and will allow us to avoid using the definition whenever possible.

0;Make sure that you can do the kind of work that we just did in this example.
0;  You will be asked numerous times over the course of the next two chapters to determine where functions are positive and or negative.
0;  If you need some review or want to practice these kinds of problems you should check out the Solving Inequalities section of my Algebra Trig Review.
