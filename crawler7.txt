An object database  also object oriented database management system  OODBMS  is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object oriented programming.
 Object databases are different from relational databases which are table oriented.
 Object relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.

An object oriented database is a database that subscribes to a model with information represented by objects.
 Object oriented databases are a niche offering in the relational database management system  RDBMS  field and are not as successful or well known as mainstream database engines.
As the name implies  the main feature of object oriented databases is allowing the definition of objects  which are different from normal database objects.
 Objects  in an object oriented database  reference the ability to develop a product  then define and name it.
 The object can then be referenced  or called later  as a unit without having to go into its complexities.
 This is very similar to objects used in object oriented programming.
 A real life parallel to objects is a car engine.
 It is composed of several parts  the main cylinder block  the exhaust system  intake manifold and so on.
 Each of these is a standalone component  but when machined and bolted into one object  they are now collectively referred to as an engine.
 Similarly  when programming one can define several components  such as a vertical line intersecting a perpendicular horizontal line while both lines have a graded measurement.
 This object can then be collectively labeled a graph.
 When utilizing the ability to plot components  there is no need to first define a graph  but rather the instance of the created graph can be called.
 Examples of object oriented database engines include db4o  Smalltalk and Cache.
There are two types of object based data Models   Entity Relationship Model and Object oriented data model.
 ER data model is one of the important data model which forms the basis for the all the designs in the database world.
 It defines the mapping between the entities in the database.
 Object oriented data model  along with the mapping between the entities  describes the state of each entity and the tasks performed by them.

Consider the example above.
 It maps entities like Student  Lecturer  Subjects  and Marks with each other to form the relation among them.
 It also list attributes of each objects.
 ER model represents the all these entities  attributes and their relationship in the form of picture to make the developer understand the system better.
 A simple ER diagram for above example can be drawn as below.
 Are you able to understand what are the entities involved  what are its attributes and their relations that we were discussing better here  Yes  it is clean and clear what a STUDENT database look like.
 It gives the clear understanding of how they are scattered and mapped.
 If we have missed any entities or attribute or the mapping  we can easily identify here.
 If we represent it in some tables  it would be difficult to identify this gap.

Let us consider an Employee database to understand this model better.
 In this database we have different types of employees   Engineer  Accountant  Manager  Clark.
 But all these employees belong to Person group.
 Person can have different attributes like name  address  age and phone.
 What do we do if we want to get a person s address and phone number  We write two separate procedure sp getAddress and sp getPhone.

Object oriented database models have been around since the seventies when the concept of object oriented programming was first explored.
 For several reasons  however  it has not caught on for any major publicly traded organization.
 It is only in the last ten or fifteen years that companies are utilizing object oriented DBMSs  OODBMS .
 The major problem for OODBMSs was that relational DBMSs  RDBMS  were already implemented industry wide.
 Companies preferred to stick with the applications they knew how to use  and had the greatest amount of technical support for.
 As time passes  this perspective becomes more and more antiquated because object oriented programming has become the preferred technique used by developers  largely due to its superior efficiency and flexibility .
