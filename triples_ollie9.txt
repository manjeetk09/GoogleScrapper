when x is less than 2, it gives x2,.
0.621: (it; gives; x2)
0.61: (x; is less than; 2)

when x is exactly 2 it gives 6.
0.674: (it; gives; 6)
0.511: (x; is exactly; 2)

when x is more than 2 and less than or equal to 6 it gives the line 10_x.
0.678: (it; gives; the line 10_x)

You may be asked to write a piecewise function, given a graph.
0.817: (You; to write; a piecewise function)

  Now that we know what piecewise functions are all about, it s not that bad  To review how to obtain equations from linear graphs, see Obtaining the Equations of a Line, and from quadratics, see Finding a Quadratic Equation from Points or a Graph.
0.709: (equations; to be obtain from; linear graphs)
0.31: (it; s see Finding; a Quadratic Equation)

 Here are the graphs, with explanations on how to derive their piecewise equations.
