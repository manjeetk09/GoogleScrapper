A programming language is said to be Turing_complete if it is in the same computational class as a Turing machine  that is to say, that it can perform any calculation that a universal Turing machine can.
0.736: (A programming language; is said; Turing_complete)
0.647: (it; can perform; any calculation that a universal Turing machine can)
0.14: (it; is in; the same computational class)
0.079: (it; is as; a Turing machine)

 This is considered significant because, under the Church_Turing thesis, a Turing machine is the embodiment of the intuitive notion of an algorithm.
