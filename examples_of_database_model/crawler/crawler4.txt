0;A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally_described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.

0;A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.
0; Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.
0; Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.
0; For example, a typical business order entry database would include a table that described a customer with columns for name, address, phone number, and so forth.
0; Another table would describe an order.
0; product, customer, date, sales price, and so forth.
0; A user of the database could obtain a view of the database that fitted the user s needs.
0; For example, a branch office manager might like a view or report on all customers that had bought products after a certain date.
0; A financial services manager in the same company could, from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that needed to be paid.

0;The relational data model describes the world as  a collection of inter_related relations  .
0;.
0;The principal storage units are called columns, or fields, or attributes.
0; These will house the basic components of data that your content can be broken down into.
0; When deciding which fields to create you need to think generically about your information.
0;  For example, drawing out the common components of the information that you will store in the database, and avoiding the specifics that distinguish one item from another.
0;.
0;The relational database model consists of three parts.
0; data structure , data integrity, and data manipulation.
0; The data structure model defines how to represent data.
0; Most basic to the data structure model is the relation which is illustrated below.
0;Another fundamental part of the relation model data structure is the concept of a domain.
0; Simply stated, a domain combines two pieces of information _ the set of allowable values that an attribute , and the semantics of the values.
0;  In other words, a domain defines a set of allowable values.
0; For example, for the ID column the domain is the set of all integers greater than zero, whereas for the Dept column the domain is the set of   Sales, Marketing, Research, Accountancy .

0;The most common relational model is one where a single record in the parenttable relates to multiple records in the child table.
0; This is called aone_to_many relationship.
0; The sales leads example is a one_to_manyrelationship because one record in the Companies table can relate to manyrecords in the Contacts table .
0; In these models, the  many  table is theone where you add the foreign key.
0;Another example of a one_to_many relationship is an application that tracksaccounts_ receivable invoices.
0; You need one table for the invoice dataand another for the customer data .
0; In this case, onecustomer can place many orders, so Customers is the parent table, Invoices isthe child table, and the common field is the Customer table s primarykey.
