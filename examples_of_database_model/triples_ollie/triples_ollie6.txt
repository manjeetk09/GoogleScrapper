The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships.
0.882: (a database model; conceived as; a flexible way representing objects and their relationships)
0.667: (The network model; is; a database model)

 Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.
0.794: (the schema; be viewed as; a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs)
