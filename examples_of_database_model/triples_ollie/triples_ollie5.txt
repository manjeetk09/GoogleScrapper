In hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree like structure with each record is having one parent record and many children.
0.925: (data; is organized into; a tree)
0.797: (data; is organized in; hierarchical model)

 The main drawback of this model is that, it can have only one to many relationships between nodes.
0.711: (it; can have; only one)

Example of hierarchical data represented as relational tables.
0.705: (hierarchical data; be represented as; relational tables)

 The above hierarchical model can be represented as relational tables like this.

The hierarchical model was the first database model developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional file system.
0.853: (the first database model; developed to overcome; the limitations of the traditional file system)

  Hierarchical databases were predominantly used for transaction processing where the volume of transactions is large and the transaction operations change little over time.

In figure 1, the node at level 1 is called the root node and the nodes at that has no children are called leaves  For example, node 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 .

0.237: (no children; be leaves for; example)
0.183: (leaves; has are called for; example)

Nodes that are children of the same parent are called siblings  For example, nodes 2, 3, 4 are siblings .
0.868: (Nodes; are children of; the same parent)

For any node there is a single path called the hierarchical path from the root node  The nodes along this path are called that nodes ancestors .
0.736: (the hierarchical path; be called from; the root node)

Similarly for a given node, any node along a path from that node to leaf is called its descendent .
0.632: (any node; Similarly for a given node is called; its descendent)

For example, suppose we have to find out the hierarchical path of node 10, then it will be 1 2 6 10 and the ancestors of node 10 are 1, 2 and 6 .
0.729: (we; have to find out; the hierarchical path of node 10)
0.618: (it; will be the ancestors of; node 10)
0.584: (it; then will be; 1 2 6 10 and the ancestors of node 10)

The height of tree is the number of levels on the longest hierarchical path from the root to a leaf  The above tree has a height  4 .
0.939: (The height of tree; is the number of; levels)
0.927: (The height of tree; is the number of levels on; the longest hierarchical path)
0.908: (The height of tree; is the number of levels from; the root)
0.87: (The height of tree; is the number of levels to; a leaf)
0.804: (The height of tree; is; the number of levels)
0.574: (the number of levels; has; a height 4)
0.492: (the number of levels; be The height of; tree)

A tree is said to be balanced if every path from the root node to a leaf has the same length .

The Hierarchical Data Model is a way of organizing a database with multiple one to many relationships.
0.792: (The Hierarchical Data Model; is; a way organizing a database with multiple one to many relationships)

  The structure is based on the rule that one parent can have many children but children are allowed only one parent.
0.908: (The structure; is based on; the rule)
0.627: (one parent; can have; many children)

  This structure allows information to be repeated through the parent child relations created by IBM and was implemented mainly in their Information Management System.

  Advantages.
No extractions found.

 The model allows easy addition and deletion of new information.
0.833: (The model; allows; easy addition and deletion of new information)

  Data at the top of the Hierarchy is very fast to access.
0.866: (Data; is very fast to; access)

  It was very easy to work with the model because it worked well with linear type data storage such as tapes.
0.722: (it; worked well with; linear type data storage)
0.7: (It; was very; easy)

  The model relates very well to natural hierarchies such as assembly plants and employee organization in corporations.
0.823: (The model; relates very well to; natural hierarchies)

  It relates well to anything that works through a one to many relationship.
0.854: (It; relates well to; anything that works through a one to many relationship)
0.767: (anything; works through; one)
0.687: (anything; works to; many relationship)

  For example  there is a president with many managers below them, and those managers have many employees below them, but each employee has only one manager.
0.783: (a president; have; many employees)
0.783: (those managers; have; many employees)
0.716: (each employee; has; only one manager)
0.307: (a president; is for; example)
0.307: (those managers; is for; example)

 This model has many issues that hold it back now that we require more sophisticated relationships.
0.778: (This model; has; many issues that hold it back now that we require more sophisticated relationships)
0.393: (we; now require; more sophisticated relationships)[attrib=that hold it back]

  It requires data to be repetitively stored in many different entities.
0.819: (data; to be repetitively stored in; many different entities)
0.782: (It; requires; data to be repetitively stored in many different entities)

  The database can be very slow when searching for information on the lower entities.
0.713: (The database; can be very; slow)

  We no longer use linear data storage mediums such as tapes so that advantage is null.
