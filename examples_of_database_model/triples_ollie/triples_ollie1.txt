Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled.
No extractions found.

 Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS.
0.691: (abstraction; to be introduce in; a DBMS.)

 Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.
0.92: (they; be stored inside; the system)[attrib=Data models define]
0.894: (data; is connected to; each other)[attrib=Data models define]
0.852: (they; is connected to; each other)[attrib=Data models define]
0.807: (data; be stored inside; the system)[attrib=Data models define]

Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes.
0.718: (Entity; is; a real_world entity having properties)
0.561: (Entity; be An entity in; an ER Model)

 Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain.
No extractions found.

 For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity.
0.914: (a student; is considered as; an entity)
0.754: (a student; is considered in; a school database)
0.46: (a student; is considered for; example)

 Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc.
0.768: (Student; has; various attributes)
0.343: (age; be various attributes like; name)

Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes  Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain  For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity  Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc .
0.718: (Entity; is; a real_world entity having properties)
0.661: (an entity Student; has; various attributes)
0.561: (Entity; be An entity in; an ER Model)
0.343: (age; be various attributes like; name)

Relationship   The logical association among entities is called relationship  Relationships are mapped with entities in various ways  Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities  Mapping cardinalities   one to one one to many many to one many to many.
0.94: (relationship Relationships; are mapped with; entities)
0.911: (cardinalities; define the number of association between; two entities Mapping cardinalities one to one one to many many to one many to many)
0.877: (the number of association; be define between; two entities Mapping cardinalities one to one one to many many to one many to many)
0.874: (cardinalities; define; the number of association)

A database model is primarily a type of data model.
0.93: (A database model; is primarily a type of; data model)
0.816: (A database model; is primarily; a type of data model)

 Depending on the model in use, a database model can include entities, their relationships, data flow, tables and more.
0.756: (a database model; can include; entities , their relationships , data flow , tables and more)

 For example, within a hierarchal database mode, the data model organizes data in the form of a tree_like structure having parent and child segments.
