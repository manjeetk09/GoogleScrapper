An object database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object_oriented programming.
0.945: (information; is represented in; the form of objects)
0.802: (An object database; is; a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object_oriented programming)

 Object databases are different from relational databases which are table_oriented.
0.823: (Object databases; are different from; relational databases which are table_oriented)

 Object_relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.

An object_oriented database is a database that subscribes to a model with information represented by objects.
0.736: (An object_oriented database; is; a database that subscribes to a model with information)
0.705: (information; be represented by; objects)
0.616: (a database; be subscribes to; a model)

 Object_oriented databases are a niche offering in the relational database management system field and are not as successful or well_known as mainstream database engines.

As the name implies, the main feature of object_oriented databases is allowing the definition of objects, which are different from normal database objects.
0.667: (the main feature of object_oriented databases; is allowing; the definition of objects)[enabler=As the name implies]

 Objects, in an object_oriented database, reference the ability to develop a product, then define and name it.
0.815: (Objects; reference the ability to be develop a product in; an object_oriented database)

 The object can then be referenced, or called later, as a unit without having to go into its complexities.
0.911: (The object; can then be referenced as; a unit)

 This is very similar to objects used in object_oriented programming.
0.705: (objects; be used in; object_oriented programming)

 A real_life parallel to objects is a car engine.

 Each of these is a standalone component  but when machined and bolted into one object, they are now collectively referred to as an engine.
0.92: (they; are now collectively referred as; an engine)

 Similarly, when programming one can define several components, such as a vertical line intersecting a perpendicular horizontal line while both lines have a graded measurement.
0.729: (programming one; can define; several components)[enabler=while both lines have a graded measurement]
0.592: (both lines; have; a graded measurement)
0.24: (several; be components as; a vertical line intersecting)

 This object can then be collectively labeled a graph.
0.763: (This object; can then be collectively labeled; a graph)

 When utilizing the ability to plot components, there is no need to first define a graph  but rather the instance of the created graph can be called.

There are two types of object based data Models   Entity Relationship Model and Object oriented data model.
No extractions found.

 ER data model is one of the important data model which forms the basis for the all the designs in the database world.
0.724: (ER data model; is; one of the important data model)
0.564: (the basis; be forms by; the important data model)

 It defines the mapping between the entities in the database.
0.722: (It; defines; the mapping)

 Object oriented data model, along with the mapping between the entities, describes the state of each entity and the tasks performed by them.
0.82: (Object oriented data model; describes; the state of each entity and the tasks performed by them)
0.774: (the state of each entity and the tasks; be performed by; them)

0.543: (It; be Marks with; each other)

 It also list attributes of each objects.
0.74: (It; also list; attributes of each objects)

 ER model represents the all these entities, attributes and their relationship in the form of picture to make the developer understand the system better.
0.806: (ER model; represents; the all these entities , attributes and their relationship in the form of picture to make the developer understand the system better)

 Person can have different attributes like name, address, age and phone.
0.822: (Person; can have; different attributes)
