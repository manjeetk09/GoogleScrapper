A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized and manipulated.
0.957: (A database model; is a type of; data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines)
0.725: (A database model; is; a type of data model)

 The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table_based format.

A Database model defines the logical design of data.
0.833: (A Database model; defines; the logical design of data)

 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
0.807: (The model; describes; the relationships)
0.303: (different; be parts of; the data)

 Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.

Entity_Relationship Model is based on the notion of real_world entities and relationships among them.
0.921: (Entity_Relationship Model; is based on; the notion of real_world entities)

 While formulating real_world scenario into the database model, the ER Model creates entity set, relationship set, general attributes and constraints.
0.547: (formulating real_world scenario; creates; entity set)

Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes.
0.718: (Entity; is; a real_world entity having properties)
0.561: (Entity; be An entity in; an ER Model)

 Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain.

 For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity.
0.914: (a student; is considered as; an entity)
0.754: (a student; is considered in; a school database)
0.46: (a student; is considered for; example)

 Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc.
0.768: (Student; has; various attributes)
0.343: (age; be various attributes like; name)

Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes  Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain  For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity  Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc .
0.718: (Entity; is; a real_world entity having properties)
0.661: (an entity Student; has; various attributes)
0.561: (Entity; be An entity in; an ER Model)
0.343: (age; be various attributes like; name)

Relationship   The logical association among entities is called relationship  Relationships are mapped with entities in various ways  Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities  Mapping cardinalities   one to one one to many many to one many to many.
0.94: (relationship Relationships; are mapped with; entities)
0.911: (cardinalities; define the number of association between; two entities Mapping cardinalities one to one one to many many to one many to many)

A database model is primarily a type of data model.
0.93: (A database model; is primarily a type of; data model)
0.816: (A database model; is primarily; a type of data model)

 Depending on the model in use, a database model can include entities, their relationships, data flow, tables and more.
0.756: (a database model; can include; entities , their relationships , data flow , tables and more)

 For example, within a hierarchal database mode, the data model organizes data in the form of a tree_like structure having parent and child segments.

In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments.
0.747: (us; take; the example of the sample database)
0.723: (the sample database; consisting of; supplier , parts and shipments)
0.676: (us; be the example of; the sample database consisting of supplier , parts and shipments)

 The record structure and some sample records for supplier, parts and shipments elements are as given in following tables.
