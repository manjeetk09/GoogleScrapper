Supervised	VBN

is	VBZ
a	DT
type	NN
of	IN
machine	NN
learning	NN
algorithm	NN
that	WDT
uses	VBZ
a	DT
known	JJ
dataset	NN
called	VBD
the	DT
training	NN
dataset	NN
to	TO
make	VB
predictions	NNS
.	.

The	DT
training	NN
dataset	NN
includes	VBZ
input	NN
data	NNS
and	CC
response	NN
values	NNS

build	VB
a	DT

of	IN
the	DT

A	DT
