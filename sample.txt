Compatibility of systems of linear constraints over the set of natural numbers. 
Criteria of compatibility of a system of linear Diophantine equations, strict inequations, and nonstrict inequations are considered. 
The most widely used learning algorithms are Support Vector Machines, linear regression, logistic regression, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, k nearest neighbor algorithm, and Neural Networks  Multilayer perceptron .
These criteria and the corresponding algorithms for constructing a minimal supporting set of solutions can be used in solving all the considered types of systems and systems of mixed types.
