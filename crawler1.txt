The Propagating Cipher Block Chaining or plaintext cipherblock chaining mode was designed to cause small changes in the ciphertext to propagate indefinitely when decrypting, as well as when encrypting.
 In PCBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with both the previous plaintext block and the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted.
 As with CBC mode, an initialization vector is used in the first block.

Cipher block chaining  is a mode of operation for a block cipher .
 Cipher block chaining uses what is known as an initialization vector  of a certain length.
 One of its key characteristics is that it uses a chaining mechanism that causes the decryption of a block of ciphertext to depend on all the preceding ciphertext blocks.
 As a result, the entire validity of all preceding blocks is contained in the immediately previous ciphertext block.
 A single bit error in a ciphertext block affects the decryption of all subsequent blocks.
 Rearrangement of the order of the ciphertext blocks causes decryption to become corrupted.
 Basically, in cipher block chaining, each plaintext block is XORed  with the immediately previous ciphertext block, and then encrypted.

A typical example of weakness of encryption using ECB mode is encoding a bitmap image  for example a .
bmp file .
 Even a strong encryption algorithm that uses ECB mode, cannot blur efficiently its content.
In CBC mode, the current plaintext block is added to the previous ciphertext block, and then the result is encrypted with the key.
 Decryption is thus the reverse process, which involves decrypting the current ciphertext and then adding the previous ciphertext block to the result.
Apparently, CFB mode is converting a block cipher into a type of stream cipher.
 The encryption algorithm is used as a keystream generator to produce keystream that is placed in the bottom register.
 This key stream is then XORed with the plaintext as in case of stream cipher.
A streamcipher is usually built by combining a blockcipher and some sort of feedback via some simple operations.
 The most simple streamcipher is the electronic codebook  mode  No chaining is used.
 The plaintext is partitioned into n blocks P1,.

, Pn of size b .
  If the last block Pn is shorter than b it is padded appropriately.
  The ciphertext blocks C1,.

, Cn are obtained by applying the blockcipher to each block of the plaintext.
 More formally, Ci   EK .
 Decryption is simple, too  Pi   DK .
 This simplicity has an important drawback  If a block B appears several times in the plaintext each occurence encrypts to the same ciphertext block.
 This can be exploited by an attacker  Suppose that the attacker knows P1  then he is able to detect every occurence of P1 in the plaintext without knowing the key .
