1;An object_relational database combines the two related structures
1;Physical data models include
1; Inverted index

1; Associative model
1; Correlational model
1; Multidimensional model
1; Multivalue model
1; Semantic model
1; XML database
1; Named graph
1; Triplestore
1;A given database management system may provide one or more models
1; The optimal structure depends on the natural organization of the application s data, and on the application s requirements, which include transaction rate , reliability, maintainability, scalability, and cost
1; Most database management systems are built around one particular data model, although it is possible for products to offer support for more than one model
1;Various physical data models can implement any given logical model
1; Most database software will offer the user some level of control in tuning the physical implementation, since the choices that are made have a significant effect on performance
1;A model is not just a way of structuring data
1; The relational model, for example, defines operations such as select and join
1; Although these operations may not be explicit in a particular query language, they provide the foundation on which a query language is built

1;The flat model consists of a single, two_dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another
1;The flat model consists of a single, two_dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another
1; For instance, columns for name and password that might be used as a part of a system security database
1; Each row would have the specific password associated with an individual user
1; This tabular format is a precursor to the relational model
1;These models were popular in the 1960s, 1970s, but nowadays can be found primarily in old legacy systems
1; They are characterized primarily by being navigational with strong connections between their logical and physical representations, and deficiencies in data independence
1;In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree_like structure, implying a single parent for each record
1;In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree_like structure, implying a single parent for each record
1; A sort field keeps sibling records in a particular order
1; Hierarchical structures were widely used in the early mainframe database management systems, such as the Information Management System by IBM, and now describe the structure of XML documents
1; This structure allows one one_to_many relationship between two types of data
1; This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world  recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs verses, any nested and sorted information
1; This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world  recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs verses, any nested and sorted information
1;This hierarchy is used as the physical order of records in storage
1; Such limitations have been compensated for in later IMS versions by additional logical hierarchies imposed on the base physical hierarchy
1;The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing many_to_many relationships in a tree_like structure that allows multiple parents
1; It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification
1; It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification
1;The network model organizes data using two fundamental concepts, called records and sets
1; Records contain fields 
1; Sets define one_to_many relationships between records
1; one owner, many members
1; A record may be an owner in any number of sets, and a member in any number of sets
1;g
1;, type A is the owner of B
1; At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A
1; Thus all the sets comprise a general directed graph , or network construct
1; Access to records is either sequential or by navigation in the circular linked lists
1;The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
1;The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
1; a program maintains a current position, and navigates from one record to another by following the relationships in which the record participates
1; Records can also be located by supplying key values
1;Although it is not an essential feature of the model, network databases generally implement the set relationships by means of pointers that directly address the location of a record on disk
1; This gives excellent retrieval performance, at the expense of operations such as database loading and reorganization
1;Popular DBMS products that utilized it were Cincom Systems  Total and Cullinet s IDMS
1; IDMS gained a considerable customer base  in the 1980s, it adopted the relational model and SQL in addition to its original tools and languages

1;Most object databases use the navigational concept to provide fast navigation across networks of objects, generally using object identifiers as  smart  pointers to related objects

1; relations, attributes, and domains
1; A relation is a table with columns and rows
1; The named columns of the relation are called attributes, and the domain is the set of values the attributes are allowed to take

1; The columns enumerate the various attributes of the entity , and a row is an actual instance of the entity that is represented by the relation
1; As a result, each tuple of the employee table represents various attributes of a single employee
1; First, the ordering of columns is immaterial in a table
1; Second, there can t be identical tuples or rows in a table
1;A relational database contains multiple tables, each similar to the one in the  flat  database model
1; One of the strengths of the relational model is that, in principle, any value occurring in two different records , implies a relationship among those two records
1; Yet, in order to enforce explicit integrity constraints, relationships between records in tables can also be defined explicitly, by identifying or non_identifying parent_child relationships characterized by assigning cardinality  1
1;1, 1
1;M, M
1;M 
1; Tables can also have a designated single attribute or a set of attributes that can act as a  key , which can be used to uniquely identify each tuple in the table
1; For example, an Employee table may contain a column named Location which contains a value that matches the key of a Location table
1; Any column can be a key, or multiple columns can be grouped together into a compound key
1; It is not necessary to define all the keys in advance  a column can be used as a key even if it was not originally intended to be one

1; It is not necessary to define all the keys in advance  a column can be used as a key even if it was not originally intended to be one
1; If no natural key is suitable , an arbitrary or surrogate key can be assigned 
1; In practice, most databases have both generated and natural keys, because generated keys can be used internally to create links between rows that cannot break, while natural keys can be used, less reliably, for searches and for integration with other databases

1;Graph databases allow even more general structure than a network database  any node may be connected to any other node
1;Multivalue databases are  lumpy  data, in that they can store exactly the same way as relational databases, but they also permit a level of depth which the relational model can only approximate using sub_tables
1; This is nearly identical to the way XML expresses data, where a given field attribute can have multiple right answers at the same time
1; Multivalue can be thought of as a compressed form of XML
1;An example is an invoice, which in either multivalue or relational data could be seen as Invoice Header Table _ one entry per invoice, and Invoice Detail Table _ one entry per line item
1; In the multivalue model, we have the option of storing the data as on table, with an embedded table to represent the detail
1; Invoice Table _ one entry per invoice, no other tables needed
1; This also results in fewer reads, less referential integrity issues, and a dramatic decrease in the hardware needed to support a given transaction volume
1; This aims to avoid the object_relational impedance mismatch _ the overhead of converting information between its representation in the database and its representation in the application program 
1; Even further, the type system used in a particular application can be defined directly in the database, allowing the database to enforce the same data integrity invariants
1;A variety of these ways have been triedfor storing objects in a database
1; This typically requires the addition of some kind of query language, since conventional programming languages do not have the ability to find objects based on their information content
1; This typically requires the addition of some kind of query language, since conventional programming languages do not have the ability to find objects based on their information content
1; Others have attacked the problem from the database end, by defining an object_oriented data model for the database, and defining a database programming language that allows full programming capabilities as well as traditional query facilities
1; usually specialized applications such as engineering databases or molecular biology databases rather than mainstream commercial data processing
1;An alternative to translating between objects and relational databases is to use an object_relational mapping library

1;A database model shows the logical structure of a database, including the relationships and constraints that determine how data can be stored and accessed
1; Individual database models are designed based on the rules and concepts of whichever broader data model the designers adopt
1; Most data models can be represented by an accompanying database diagram
1;There are many kinds of data models
1; Some of the most common ones include
1; Hierarchical database model
1; Relational model
1; Network model
1; Object_oriented database model
1; Entity_relationship model
1; Document model
1; Entity_attribute_value model
1; Star schema
1; The object_relational model, which combines the two that make up its name
1;You may choose to describe a database with any one of these depending on several factors
1; The biggest factor is whether the database management system you are using supports a particular model
1; Most database management systems are built with a particular data model in mind and require their users to adopt that model, although some do support multiple models
1;In addition, different models apply to different stages of the database design process
1; High_level conceptual data models are best for mapping out relationships between data in ways that people perceive that data
1; Record_based logical models, on the other hand, more closely reflect ways that the data is stored on the server
1;Selecting a data model is also a matter of aligning your priorities for the database with the strengths of a particular model, whether those priorities include speed, cost reduction, usability, or something else

1;Let s take a closer look at some of the most common database models
1;The most common model, the relational model sorts data into tables, also known as relations, each of which consists of columns and rows
1; Each column lists an attribute of the entity in question, such as price, zip code, or birth date
1;The model also accounts for the types of relationships between those tables, including one_to_one, one_to_many, and many_to_many relationships
1; Here s an example
1;Within the database, tables can be normalized, or brought to comply with normalization rules that make the database flexible, adaptable, and scalable
1; When normalized, each piece of data is atomic, or broken into the smallest useful pieces
1; The model was introduced by E
1;F
1; Codd in 1970
1;The hierarchical model organizes data into a tree_like structure, where each record has a single parent or root
1;The hierarchical model organizes data into a tree_like structure, where each record has a single parent or root
1; Sibling records are sorted in a particular order
1; That order is used as the physical order for storing the database
1; This model is good for describing many real_world relationships
1;The network model builds on the hierarchical model by allowing many_to_many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent records
1;The network model builds on the hierarchical model by allowing many_to_many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent records
1; Each set consists of one owner or parent record and one or more member or child records
1; A record can be a member or child in multiple sets, allowing this model to convey complex relationships
1; A record can be a member or child in multiple sets, allowing this model to convey complex relationships
1;It was most popular in the 70s after it was formally defined by the Conference on Data Systems Languages 
1;This model defines a database as a collection of objects, or reusable software elements, with associated features and methods
1; There are several kinds of object_oriented databases
1;A hypertext database allows any object to link to any other object
1; It s useful for organizing lots of disparate data, but it s not ideal for numerical analysis
1;The object_oriented database model is the best known post_relational database model, since it incorporates tables, but isn t limited to tables
1;This hybrid database model combines the simplicity of the relational model with some of the advanced functionality of the object_oriented database model
1; In essence, it allows designers to incorporate objects into the familiar table structure
1;Languages and call interfaces include SQL3, vendor languages, ODBC, JDBC, and proprietary call interfaces that are extensions of the languages and interfaces used by the relational model
1;Languages and call interfaces include SQL3, vendor languages, ODBC, JDBC, and proprietary call interfaces that are extensions of the languages and interfaces used by the relational model
1;This model captures the relationships between real_world entities much like the network model, but it isn t as directly tied to the physical structure of the database
1; Instead, it s often used for designing a database conceptually
1;Here, the people, places, and things about which data points are stored are referred to as entities, each of which has certain attributes that together make up their domain
1;Here, the people, places, and things about which data points are stored are referred to as entities, each of which has certain attributes that together make up their domain
1; The cardinality, or relationships between entities, are mapped as well
1;A common form of the ER diagram is the star schema, in which a central fact table connects to multiple dimensional tables

1;A variety of other database models have been or are still used today
1;A database built with the inverted file structure is designed to facilitate fast full text searches
1; In this model, data content is indexed as a series of keys in a lookup table, with the values pointing to the location of the associated files

1;This is a variation of the relational model designed to facilitate improved analytical processing
1;Each cell in a dimensional database contains data about the dimensions tracked by the database
1; Here the distinction between data and schema is vague at best
1; This model is useful for describing systems, such as certain Web_based data sources, which we treat as databases but cannot constrain with a schema
1; It cobbles together elements from object_oriented, semistructured, and network models
1;This model divides all the data points based on whether they describe an entity or an association
1;This model divides all the data points based on whether they describe an entity or an association
1; In this model, an entity is anything that exists independently, whereas an association is something that only exists in relation to something else
1;The associative model structures the data into two sets
1; A set of items, each with a unique identifier, a name, and a type
1; The stored fact has to do with the source, and each of the three identifiers may refer either to a link or an item
1;Other, less common database models include
1; Named graph
1; Triplestore
1;The multivalue model, which breaks from the relational model by allowing attributes to contain a list of data rather than a single data point

1;Most websites rely on some kind of database to organize and present data to users
1; Whenever someone uses the search functions on these sites, their search terms are converted into queries for a database server to process

1;Data models define how the logical structure of a database is modeled
1; Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS

1; Data models define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system
1;The very first data model could be flat data_models, where all the data used are to be kept in the same plane
1; Earlier data models were not so scientific, hence they were prone to introduce lots of duplication and update anomalies
1;Entity_Relationship Model is based on the notion of real_world entities and relationships among them
1; While formulating real_world scenario into the database model, the ER Model creates entity set, relationship set, general attributes and constraints
1;ER Model is based on   Entities and their attributes
1; Relationships among entities
1;Entities and their attributes
1;Relationships among entities
1;These concepts are explained below
1;Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes
1;Entity   An entity in an ER Model is a real_world entity having properties called attributes
1; Every attribute is defined by its set of values called domain
1; For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity
1; For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity
1; For example, in a school database, a student is considered as an entity
1; Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc
1; Student has various attributes like name, age, class, etc
1;Relationship   The logical association among entities is called relationship
1; Relationships are mapped with entities in various ways
1; Mapping cardinalities define the number of association between two entities

1;The most popular data model in DBMS is the Relational Model
1; It is more scientific a model than others
1; This model is based on first_order predicate logic and defines a table as an n_ary relation
1;The main highlights of this model are   Data is stored in tables called relations
1; Relations can be normalized
1; Each row in a relation contains a unique value
1; Each column in a relation contains values from a same domain

1;                
1;Sample Database
1;In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
1;In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
1;In order to understand the hierarchical data model better, let us take the example of the sample database consisting of supplier, parts and shipments
1; The record structure and some sample records for supplier, parts and shipments elements are as given in following tables
1;                              
1;                                
1; Also we assume that no more than one shipment exists for a given supplier part combination in the shipments table
1;The tree structure has parts record superior to supplier record
1; That is parts form the parent and supplier forms the children
1; Each of the four trees figure, consists of one part record occurrence, together with a set of subordinate supplier record occurrences
1; There is one supplier record for each supplier of a particular part
1; Each supplier occurrence includes the corresponding shipment quantity
1;                                
1;For example, supplier S3 supplies 300 quantities of part P2
1;There are four basic operations Insert, Update, Delete and Retrieve that can be performed on each model
1;Insert Operation
1; It is not possible to insert the information of the supplier e
1;g
1; S4 who does not supply any part
1; So, we can say that insert anomaly exists only for those children, which has no corresponding parents
1; So, we can say that insert anomaly exists only for those children, which has no corresponding parents
1;Update Operation
1; So, we can say that update anomalies only exist for children not for parent because children may have multiple entries in the database
1;Delete Operation
1; For example
1; In hierarchical model, deletion of parent causes the deletion of child records also and if the child occurrence is the only occurrence in the whole database, then the information of child records will also lost with the deletion of parent
1; For example
1;Record Retrieval
1;Query1
1; Find the supplier number for suppliers who supply part P2
1;Solution
1; In order to get this information, first we search the information of parent P2 from database, since parent occurs only once in the whole database, so we obtain only a single record for P2
1;Algorithm
1;get  part where PNO P2 
1;do until no more shipments under this part 
1;print SNO 
1;end 
1;Query2
1;Solution
1; If supplier S2, is found under a part then the corresponding part number is printed, otherwise we go to next part until all the parts are searched for supplier S2
1;Algorithm
1;do until no more parts 
1;get next part 
1;if found then print PNO 
1;end 
1;In above algorithms  next  is interpreted relative the current position 
1;Since, both the queries involved different logic and are complex, so we can conclude that retrieval operation of this model is complex and asymmetric
1;Conclusion
1; As explained earlier, we can conclude that hierarchical model suffers from the Insertion anomalies, Update anomalies and Deletion anomalies, also the retrieval operation is complex and asymmetric, and thus hierarchical model is not suitable for all the cases

1; Complexity of Implementation
1; The actual implementation of a hierarchical database depends on the physical storage of data
1; The actual implementation of a hierarchical database depends on the physical storage of data
1; This makes the implementation complicated
1;2
1; Difficulty in Management
1; The movement of a data segment from one location to another cause all the accessing programs to be modified making database management a complex affair
1;3
1; Complexity of Programming
1; Programming a hierarchical database is relatively complex because the programmers must know the physical path of the data items
1;4
1; Poor Portability
1;5
1; Database Management Problems
1; If you make any changes in the database structure of a hierarchical database, then you need to make the necessary changes in all the application programs that access the database
1; Thus, maintaining the database and the applications can become very difficult
1;6
1; Lack of structural independence
1; Hierarchical database systems use physical storage paths to navigate to the different data segments
1; So, the application programs should have a good knowledge of the relevant access paths to access the data
1; So, if the physical structure is changed the applications will also have to be modified
1;7
1; Programs Complexity

1; Implementation Limitation
1;N format required by the hierarchical model
1; The many_to_many  N
1;N  relationships, which are more common in real life are very difficult to implement in a hierarchical model
1; Some data were more naturally modeled with more than one parent per child
1; A set consists of an owner record type, a set name, and a member record type
1; A member record type can have that role in more than one set  hence the multiparent concept is supported
1; A member record type can have that role in more than one set  hence the multiparent concept is supported
1;An owner record type can also be a member or owner in another set
1; The data model is a simple network, and link and intersection record types may exist, as well as sets between them
1;M relationship, although 1
1;1 is permitted
1; The CODASYL network model is based on mathematical set theory
1;Network model is a collection data in which records are physically linked through linked lists 
1;A DBMS is said to be a Network DBMS if the relationships among data in the database are of type many_to_many
1;A DBMS is said to be a Network DBMS if the relationships among data in the database are of type many_to_many
1; The relationship among many_to_many appears in the form of a network

1;The Relational Model was the first theoretically founded and well thought out Data Model, proposed by EfCodd in 1970, then a researcher at IBM
1;The Relational Model is a depiction of how each piece of stored information relates to the other stored information
1; It shows how tables are linked, what type of links are between tables, what keys are used, what information is referenced between tables
1; It s an essential part of developing a normalized database structure to prevent repeat and redundant data storage
1;The basic idea behind the relational model is that a database consists of a series of unordered tables that can be manipulated using non_procedural operations that return tables
1; This model was in vast contrast to the more traditional database theories of the time that were much more complicated, less flexible and dependent on the physical storage methods of the data
1; The RELATIONAL database model is based on the Relational Algebra, set theory and predicate logic
1; The RELATIONAL database model is based on the Relational Algebra, set theory and predicate logic
1;It is commonly thought that the word relational in the relational model comes from the fact that you relate together tables in a relational database
1; Although this is a convenient way to think of the term, it s not accurate
1; Instead, the word relational has its roots in the terminology that Codd used to define the relational model
1; Instead, the word relational has its roots in the terminology that Codd used to define the relational model
1; The table in Codd s writings was actually referred to as a relation 
1;In fact, Codd use the terms relations, attributes and tuples where most of us use the more common terms tables, columns and rows, respectively 
1; Still, it has a long way to go before it meets all twelve rules completely
1;An object_oriented database management system is a DBMS that stores data in a logical model that is closely aligned with an application program s object model
1;An object_oriented database management system is a DBMS that stores data in a logical model that is closely aligned with an application program s object model
1; Of course, an OODBMS will have a physical data model optimized for the kinds of logical data model it expects
1;Object oriented database models have been around since the seventies when the concept of object oriented programming was first explored
1; It is only in the last ten or fifteen years that companies are utilizing object oriented DBMSs 
1;OODBMS should be used when there is a business need, high performance required, and complex data is being used
1;The result can be a performance increase of ten to one thousand times while writing as little as 40  of the code
