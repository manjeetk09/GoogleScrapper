0;Symmetric multiprocessing involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all I O devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes.
0; Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture.
0; In the case of multi_core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.

0;SMP is the processing of programs by multiple processors that share a common operating system and memory.
0; In symmetric multiprocessing, the processors share memory and the I O bus or data path.
0; A single copy of the operating system is in charge of all the processors.
0; SMP, also known as a  shared everything  system, does not usually exceed 16 processors.

0;One of the easiest and cheapest ways to improve hardware performance is to put more than one CPU on the board.
0; This can be done either making the different CPU s take on different jobs or by making them all run in parallel, doing the same job  symmetrical multi_processing, a.

0;x, this isn t a problem because the entire kernel is in one big spinlock.
0; This means that if one CPU is in the kernel and another CPU wants to get in, for example because of a system call, it has to wait until the first CPU is done.
0; This makes Linux SMP safe, but inefficient.

0;Short for Symmetric Multiprocessing, a computer architecture that provides fast performance by making multiple CPUs available to complete individual processes simultaneously .
0; Unlike asymmetrical processing, any idle processor can be assigned any task, and additional CPUs can be added to improve performance and handle increased loads.
0; A variety of specialized operating systems and hardware arrangements are available to support SMP.
0; Specific applications can benefit from SMP if the code allows multithreading.
0;Unlock the power of Linux on SMP systems.
0;An SMP architecture is simply one where two or more identical processors connect to one another through a shared memory.
0; Each processor has equal access to the shared memory .
0; Contrast this with the Non_Uniform Memory Access architecture.
0; For example, each processor has its own memory but also access to shared memory with a different access latency.
0;Asymmetric multiprocessing    In asymmetric multiprocessing the program tasks are strictly divided by type between processors and typically, each processor has its own memory address space.
0;  These features make asymmetric multiprocessing difficult to implement.
0; The two figures below are two examples of asymmetric multiprocessor configurations.
