0;A number of wonderful online function machines develop the same concept.
0; Students can work individually, in pairs, or as a class to solve the function machine puzzles.

0; Function Machine, Grades 3_4 With the option of guessing outputs, inputs, or function, this machine is a good starting point.
0; As the user makes a series of successful guesses, the functions progress from 1 to 2 rules.
0; Unfortunately, if you play again, the sequence of problems is identical.
0; Math Playground s Function Machine This machine for guessing mystery function rules lets the user control the maximum input number, with options for manual or computer inputs and 1 or 2 function rules.
0; It requires five inputs outputs before it will let the user guess the function rule.
0; Ambleside Function Machine This machine for guessing mystery function rules offers a variety of 1_ or 2_step function rules.

0; Mystery Operation This challenging function machine takes user input for two variables to produce an output.
0; After examining a series of input pairs and outputs, the user tries to deduce and apply the mystery operation to predict the output for a pair of machine_generated inputs.

0;The NCTM Standard 2 for Patterns, Functions, and Algebra expects students to.
0; understand various types of patterns and functional relationships .
0; use symbolic forms to represent and analyze mathematical situations and structures .
0; use mathematical models and analyze change in both real and abstract contexts.
0;As we point out and use functions in real_life settings, we can ask our students to keep alert for other input_output situations in the real world.
0; You might draw from the following examples.
0; A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot.
0;  The function rule is the product price.
0; The input is the money combined with the selected button.
0; The output is the product, sometimes delivered along with coins in change, if the user has entered more money than required by the function rule.

0; Measurement.
0;   Thermometer Most thermometers come with both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.
0; Students can study a thermometer as an input output table.
0; Students who have had experience in deducing composite function rules might be able to compare the two scales and figure out the mystery function rule __ the formula for converting from one scale to the other.
0; Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter.
0; Students can measure the diameter and circumference of several round containers or lids and record that data in a table.
0; If diameter is the input and circumference is the output, what s the function rule  As they divide each container s circumference by its diameter to find that rule, they should notice a constant ratio __ a rough approximation of pi.
0; Arm length is a function of height.
0; Miles per gallon A car s efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function.
0; If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles.

0; Shadows The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day.
0; Shadows can be used to find the height of large objects such as trees or buildings  the same function rule by which we compare the length of an upright ruler to its shadow will help us find the unknown input when we measure its shadow.
0; Geometric Patterns Polyhedra As they examine the relationship between the number of faces, edges, and vertices of various polyhedra, can students discover Euler s rule  F   V   E   2  The number of faces plus the number of vertices equals the number of edges plus 2.

0;We use algebra quite frequently in our everyday lives, and without even realizing it  We not only use algebra, we actually need algebra, to solve most of our problems that involves calculations.
0;Here are some simple examples that demonstrate the relevance of algebra in the real world.
0;The figure below illustrates the problem.
0; The different shapes inside the bags denote different items purchased.
0; The number depicts the item number.
0;We use simple algebraic formula  x y  to calculate the number of bags.
0;x   Number of items purchased   10.
0;y   Capacity of 1 bag   3.
0;Hence,.
0; 10 3     3.
0;33  bags    4  bags.
0;So,we need 4 shopping bags to put 10 items.
0;The figure below shows the three items in different shapes and colors.
0;This will help your mind to calculate faster.
0;We will use algebra to solve the problem easily and quickly.
0;The prices are.
0;a   Price of two dozen eggs    10.
0;b   Price of one bread    5.
0;c   Price of one bottle of juice   8.
0;   Money needed   a   3b   5c.
0;   Money needed    10   3  5   10    15    40    65.
0;In the below diagram, each block represents  1, and each row is a bundle of  3, which is used to buy 1 gallon of gas.
0;We use simple algebraic formula, x y  to calculate the total gallons that can be bought.
0;x   Money in your pocket   15.
0;y   Price of 1 gallon of gas   3.
0;Hence,.
0;      5 gallon.
0;So, with  15 we can buy 5 gallons of gas.
0;Life s many problems are disguised in the form of math equations, and if we know the math, it s fairly simple to solve those problems.
0;1.
0;  Understand the problem.
0;The task is to find three consecutive numbers whose total is 216.
0;2.
0;  Write the variable.
0;Let   x   represent the first number.
0;So,  x    first number.
0; x 1    second number.
0; x 2   third number.
0;3.
0;  Write the equation.
0;When you add up all the numbers, you are supposed to get 216.
0; x        216.
0; 3x   3    216.
0;4.
0;  Solve the equation.
0;Subtract 3 from both sides.
0; 3x   3 _ 3    216 _ 3.
0; 3x     213.
0;Divide each side by 3.
0;   3    213   3.
0; x   71 .
0;5.
0;  Check your answer.
0;First number   Second number   Third number   216.
0; x      .
0;71     .
0;71   72   73   216.
0;So the three numbers whose sum is 216 are 71, 72 and 73.
0;1.
0;  Understand the problem.
0;A group of 5 boys goes to the theatre.
0; The cost of ticket and popcorn is  55 and  25 respectively.
0; What is cost per person .
0;2.
0;  Write the variable.
0;Let s say,  x    cost of ticket person and  y    cost of popcorn person.
0;3.
0;  Write the equation.
0;If 5 tickets cost  55, then cost of one ticket is,.
0; 5x    55.
0; x      55   5 .
0;If 5 bags of popcorn cost  25, then the cost of each bag is,.
0; 5y     25.
0; y      25   5 .
0;Total cost of the movie per person    x   y  .
0;4.
0;  Solve the equation.
0;Cost of ticket person.
0; x     55   5 .
0; x     11.
0;Cost of popcorn person.
0; y      25   5 .
0; y      5.
0;5.
0;  Check your answer.
0;Cost of ticket person   Cost of popcorn person   Total cost.
0;11   5   16.
0;If we add up 16 five times , the result is,.
0;16   16   16   16   16   80.
0; 80 is the total cost.
0;1.
0;  Understand the problem.
0;The area of a rectangle is 72 cm.
0; The width is twice its length.
0; What is the length and width of the rectangle .
0;2.

0; x 2     72   2 .
0; x 2    36.
0; x    6.
0; x     Length.
0;So, the length is 6 cm.
0;The width is twice its length.
0; 2x    2 x 6   12.
0;So, the width is 12 cm.
0;5.
0;  Check your answer.
0;The length is 6 cm and width is 12 cm.
0;The perimeter i.
