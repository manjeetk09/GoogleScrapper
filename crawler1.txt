In signal processing  sampling is the reduction of a continuous time signal to a discrete time signal.
 A common example is the conversion of a sound wave  a continuous signal  to a sequence of samples  a discrete time signal .
A sample is a value or set of values at a point in time and or space.
A sampler is a subsystem or operation that extracts samples from a continuous signal.
A theoretical ideal sampler produces samples equivalent to the instantaneous value of the continuous signal at the desired points.

Sampling can be done for functions varying in space  time  or any other dimension  and similar results are obtained in two or more dimensions.
For functions that vary with time  let s t  be a continuous function  or  signal   to be sampled  and let sampling be performed by measuring the value of the continuous function every T seconds  which is called the sampling interval or the sampling period.
  Then the sampled function is given by the sequence .
The sampling frequency or sampling rate  fs  is the average number of samples obtained in one second  samples per second   thus fs   1 T.
Reconstructing a continuous function from samples is done by interpolation algorithms.
 The Whittaker Shannon interpolation formula is mathematically equivalent to an ideal lowpass filter whose input is a sequence of Dirac delta functions that are modulated  multiplied  by the sample values.
 When the time interval between adjacent samples is a constant  T   the sequence of delta functions is called a Dirac comb.
 Mathematically  the modulated Dirac comb is equivalent to the product of the comb function with s t .
 That purely mathematical abstraction is sometimes referred to as impulse sampling.
Most sampled signals are not simply stored and reconstructed.
 But the fidelity of a theoretical reconstruction is a customary measure of the effectiveness of sampling.
 That fidelity is reduced when s t  contains frequency components whose periodicity is smaller than 2 samples  or equivalently the ratio of cycles to samples exceeds    see Aliasing .
 The quantity   cycles sample   fs samples sec   fs 2 cycles sec  hertz  is known as the Nyquist frequency of the sampler.
 Therefore  s t  is usually the output of a lowpass filter  functionally known as an anti aliasing filter.
 Without an anti aliasing filter  frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency will influence the samples in a way that is misinterpreted by the interpolation process.
In practice  the continuous signal is sampled using an analog to digital converter  ADC   a device with various physical limitations.
 This results in deviations from the theoretically perfect reconstruction  collectively referred to as distortion.
Various types of distortion can occur  including .
Although the use of oversampling can completely eliminate aperture error and aliasing by shifting them out of the pass band  this technique cannot be practically used above a few GHz  and may be prohibitively expensive at much lower frequencies.
 Furthermore  while oversampling can reduce quantization error and non linearity  it cannot eliminate these entirely.
 Consequently  practical ADCs at audio frequencies typically do not exhibit aliasing  aperture error  and are not limited by quantization error.
 Instead  analog noise dominates.
 At RF and microwave frequencies where oversampling is impractical and filters are expensive  aperture error  quantization error and aliasing can be significant limitations.
Jitter  noise  and quantization are often analyzed by modeling them as random errors added to the sample values.
 Integration and zero order hold effects can be analyzed as a form of low pass filtering.
 The non linearities of either ADC or DAC are analyzed by replacing the ideal linear function mapping with a proposed nonlinear function.
Digital audio uses pulse code modulation and digital signals for sound reproduction.
 This includes analog to digital conversion  ADC   digital to analog conversion  DAC   storage  and transmission.
 In effect  the system commonly referred to as digital is in fact a discrete time  discrete level analog of a previous electrical analog.
 While modern systems can be quite subtle in their methods  the primary usefulness of a digital system is the ability to store  retrieve and transmit signals without any loss of quality.
A commonly seen measure of sampling is S s  which stands for  Samples per second.
  As an example  1 MS s is one million samples per second.
When it is necessary to capture audio covering the entire 20 20 000 Hz range of human hearing   such as when recording music or many types of acoustic events  audio waveforms are typically sampled at 44.
1 kHz  CD   48 kHz  88.
2 kHz  or 96 kHz.
  The approximately double rate requirement is a consequence of the Nyquist theorem.
 Sampling rates higher than about 50 kHz to 60 kHz cannot supply more usable information for human listeners.
 Early professional audio equipment manufacturers chose sampling rates in the region of 50 kHz for this reason.
There has been an industry trend towards sampling rates well beyond the basic requirements  such as 96 kHz and even 192 kHz  This is in contrast with laboratory experiments  which have failed to show that ultrasonic frequencies are audible to human observers  however in some cases ultrasonic sounds do interact with and modulate the audible part of the frequency spectrum  intermodulation distortion .
  It is noteworthy that intermodulation distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound.
  One advantage of higher sampling rates is that they can relax the low pass filter design requirements for ADCs and DACs  but with modern oversampling sigma delta converters this advantage is less important.
The Audio Engineering Society recommends 48 kHz sampling rate for most applications but gives recognition to 44.
1 kHz for Compact Disc and other consumer uses  32 kHz for transmission related applications  and 96 kHz for higher bandwidth or relaxed anti aliasing filtering.
A more complete list of common audio sample rates is .
Audio is typically recorded at 8   16   and 24 bit depth  which yield a theoretical maximum Signal to quantization noise ratio  SQNR  for a pure sine wave of  approximately  49.
93 dB  98.
09 dB and 122.
17 dB.
 CD quality audio uses 16 bit samples.
 Thermal noise limits the true number of bits that can be used in quantization.
 Few analog systems have signal to noise ratios  SNR  exceeding 120 dB.
 However  digital signal processing operations can have very high dynamic range  consequently it is common to perform mixing and mastering operations at 32 bit precision and then convert to 16 or 24 bit for distribution.
Speech signals  i.
e.
  signals intended to carry only human speech  can usually be sampled at a much lower rate.
 For most phonemes  almost all of the energy is contained in the 100 Hz 4 kHz range  allowing a sampling rate of 8 kHz.
 This is the sampling rate used by nearly all telephony systems  which use the G.

Standard definition television  SDTV  uses either 720 by 480 pixels  US NTSC 525 line  or 704 by 576 pixels  UK PAL 625 line  for the visible picture area.
High definition television  HDTV  uses 720p  progressive   1080i  interlaced   and 1080p  progressive  also known as Full HD .
In digital video  the temporal sampling rate is defined the frame rate   or rather the field rate   rather than the notional pixel clock.
 The image sampling frequency is the repetition rate of the sensor integration period.
 Since the integration period may be significantly shorter than the time between repetitions  the sampling frequency can be different from the inverse of the sample time .
Video digital to analog converters operate in the megahertz range  from  3 MHz for low quality composite video scalers in early games consoles  to 250 MHz or more for the highest resolution VGA output .
When analog video is converted to digital video  a different sampling process occurs  this time at the pixel frequency  corresponding to a spatial sampling rate along scan lines.
 A common pixel sampling rate is .
Spatial sampling in the other direction is determined by the spacing of scan lines in the raster.
 The sampling rates and resolutions in both spatial directions can be measured in units of lines per picture height.
Spatial aliasing of high frequency luma or chroma video components shows up as a moir  pattern.
The process of volume rendering samples a 3D grid of voxels to produce 3D renderings of sliced  tomographic  data.
 The 3D grid is assumed to represent a continuous region of 3D space.
 Volume rendering is common in medial imaging  X ray computed tomography  CT CAT   Magnetic resonance imaging  MRI   Positron Emission Tomography  PET  are some examples.
 It is also used for Seismic tomography and other applications.
When a bandpass signal is sampled slower than its Nyquist rate  the samples are indistinguishable from samples of a low frequency alias of the high frequency signal.
 That is often done purposefully in such a way that the lowest frequency alias satisfies the Nyquist criterion  because the bandpass signal is still uniquely represented and recoverable.
 Such undersampling is also known as bandpass sampling  harmonic sampling  IF sampling  and direct IF to digital conversion.
Oversampling is used in most modern analog to digital converters to reduce the distortion introduced by practical digital to analog converters  such as a zero order hold instead of idealizations like the Whittaker Shannon interpolation formula.
Complex sampling  I Q sampling  is the simultaneous sampling of two different  but related  waveforms  resulting in pairs of samples that are subsequently treated as complex numbers.
  When one waveform   s     t       displaystyle    hat  s   t      is the Hilbert transform of the other waveform   s   t       displaystyle  s t        the complex valued function    s a   t       def   s   t     j   s     t       displaystyle s  a  t     stackrel   text def        s t  j cdot   hat  s   t      is called an analytic signal   whose Fourier transform is zero for all negative values of frequency.
 In that case  the Nyquist rate for a waveform with no frequencies   B can be reduced to just B  complex samples sec   instead of 2B  real samples sec .
 More apparently  the equivalent baseband waveform    s a   t     e   j 2   B 2 t     displaystyle s  a  t  cdot e   j2 pi   frac  B  2  t      also has a Nyquist rate of B  because all of its non zero frequency content is shifted into the interval   B 2  B 2 .
Although complex valued samples can be obtained as described above  they are also created by manipulating samples of a real valued waveform.
 For instance  the equivalent baseband waveform can be created without explicitly computing s     t       displaystyle   hat  s   t      by processing the product sequence        displaystyle   left     through a digital lowpass filter whose cutoff frequency is B 2.
 Computing only every other sample of the output sequence reduces the sample rate commensurate with the reduced Nyquist rate.
 The result is half as many complex valued samples as the original number of real samples.
 No information is lost  and the original s t  waveform can be recovered  if necessary.
In signal processing  sampling is the reduction of a continuous time signal to a discrete time signal.
 A common example is the conversion of a sound wave  a continuous signal  to a sequence of samples  a discrete time signal .
A sample is a value or set of values at a point in time and or space.

Their are two types of signal exist  continuous time signal and discrete time signals.
 Due to some recent advancement in the digital signal technology over the last past few decades the light weight  programmable and easily reproducible discrete time systems are available.
 Thus in spite of having large number of continuous time signal we prefer processing of discrete signal.
 Thus conversion of continuous to discrete time signal is required.
 This phenomena is obtained by fundamental mathematical fool known as Sampling Theorem.
  Here in this post  we emphases the concept of Sampling  Sampling theorem  Sampling techniques and its effects in details.

Periodic sampling  the process of representing a continuous signal with a sequence of discrete data values  pervades the field of digital signal processing.
 In practice  sampling is performed by applying a continuous signal to an analog to digital  A D  converter whose output is a series of digital values.
 Because sampling theory plays an important role in determining the accuracy and feasibility of any digital signal processing scheme  we need a solid appreciation for the often misunderstood effects of periodic sampling.
 With regard to sampling  the primary concern is just how fast a given continuous signal must be sampled in order to preserve its information content.
 We can sample a continuous signal at any sample rate we wish  and we ll get a series of discrete values but the question is  how well do these values represent the original signal  Let s learn the answer to that question and  in doing so  explore the various sampling techniques used in digital signal processing.

Unlike implict sampling  in which samples are triggered by some aspect of signal behavior  in explicit sampling  signal values are measured at specified times without regard to the signal s behavior.
 Consider the continuous time sinusoidal signal and its two sided magnitude spectrum depicted in Figure 2.
1.
 There are three explicit sampling techniques natural sampling  instantaneous sampling  and ideal sampling that can be used to sample such a signal.
 The results produced by these techniques  and the corresponding impacts on the signal s spectrum are compared in Key Concept 2.

The definition of proper sampling is quite simple.
 Suppose you sample a continuous signal in some manner.
 If you can exactly reconstruct the analog signal from the samples  you must have done the sampling properly.
 Even if the sampled data appears confusing or incomplete  the key information has been captured if you can reverse the process.
