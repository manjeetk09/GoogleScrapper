0;A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs .
0; The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator , a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate processor.
0; Some debuggers offer two modes of operation _ full or partial simulation, to limit this impact.

0;A  crash  happens when the program cannot normally continue because of a programming bug.
0; For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory.
0; When the program  crashes  or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the position in the original code if it is a source_level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly now seen in integrated development environments.
0; If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly .

0;What does a debugging program do and how is it useful  These questions are better explained by example, but to give a quick answer, a debugging program allows you to monitor control of a program during program execution.
0; What does that mean  Well, let s give a quick example.
0; Using the debug program you can tell the program to execute until a specific statement is reached  upon reaching this statement the debugger allows you to look at and change values of different variables in the program and also the registers used by the PC .
0; The usefulness of this ability to watch your program unfold in great detail will become apparent later on.

0;Using print statements for debugging a program is often not adequate or convenient.
0; For example, the programmer may want to change the values of certain variables after observing the execution of the program till some point.
0; For a large program it may be difficult to go back to the source program, make the necessary changes and rerun the program.
0; Again, if such print statements are placed inside loops, it will produce output everytime the loop is executed though the programmer may be interested in only certain iterations of the loop.
0; To overcome several such drawbacks of debugging by inserting extra statements in the program, there are a kind of tool called debugger that helps in debugging programs by giving the programmer some control over the execution of the program and some means of examining and modifying different program variables during runtime.
0;Here are some examples of valgrind output.
0; In each case the example program is compiled with _g3 so that valgrind can report line numbers from the source code.
