0;Hierarchical Database model is one of the oldest database models, dating from late 1950s.
0; One of the first hierarchical databases Information Management System was developed jointly by North American Rockwell Company and IBM.
0; This model is like a structure of a tree with the records forming the nodes and fields forming the branches of the tree.

0;The tree structure has parts record superior to supplier record.
0; That is parts form the parent and supplier forms the children.
0; Each of the four trees figure, consists of one part record occurrence, together with a set of subordinate supplier record occurrences.
0; There is one supplier record for each supplier of a particular part.
0; Each supplier occurrence includes the corresponding shipment quantity.

0;Hierarchical Databases In the Hierarchical Database Model we have to learn about the databases.
0; It is very fast and simple.
0; In a hierarchical database, records contain information about there groups of parent child relationships, just like as a tree structure.
0; The structure implies that a record can have also a repeating information.
0; In this structure Data follows a series of records, It is a set of field values attached to it.
0; It collects all records together as a record type.
0; These record types are the equivalent of tables in the relational model, and with the individual records being the equivalent of rows.
0; To create links between these record types, the hierarchical model uses these type Relationships.

0;Advantage Hierarchical database can be accessed and updated rapidly because in this model structure is like as a tree and the relationships between records are defined in advance.
0; This feature is a two_edged.

0;Disadvantage This type of database structure is that each child in the tree may have only one parent, and relationships or linkages between children are not permitted, even if they make sense from a logical standpoint.
0; Hierarchical databases are so in their design.
0; it can adding a new field or record requires that the entire database be redefined.
0; Network Database A network databases are mainly used on a large digital computers.
0; It more connections can be made between different types of data, network databases are considered more efficiency It contains limitations must be considered when we have to use this kind of database.
0; It is Similar to the hierarchical databases, network databases .
0;Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases by also having a hierarchical structure.
0; A network database looks more like a cobweb or interconnected network of records.

0;The relational database organizes data in a series of tables.
0; Each table has its own fields specific to the type of data being stored.
0; The database management system designed around the relationships between tables has survived more than two decades because of its flexibility.
0; Once the user enters data into a table and saves it in the massive database, a query will recall the information at any time.
