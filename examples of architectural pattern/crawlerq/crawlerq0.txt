In TOGAF, patterns are considered to be a way of putting building blocks into context  for example, to describe a re_usable solution to a problem.
 Building blocks are what you use.
 patterns can tell you how you use them, when, why, and what trade_offs you have to make in doing so.
This chapter describes and discusses high level patterns and principles commonly used for applications today.
 These are often referred to as the architectural styles, and include patterns such as client server, layered architecture, component_based architecture, message bus architecture, and service_oriented architecture .
 For each style, you will find an overview, key principles, major benefits, and information that will help you choose the appropriate architectural styles for your application.
 It is important to understand that the styles describe different aspects of applications.
 For example, some architectural styles describe deployment patterns, some describe structure and design issues, and others describe communication factors.
 Therefore, a typical application will usually use a combination of more than one of the styles described in this chapter.
