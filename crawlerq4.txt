A function is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic operations on polynomials.
Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function.

Think of all the graphing that you ve done so far.
 The simplest method is to solve for  y   , make a T_chart, pick some values for x, solve for the corresponding values of y, plot your points, and connect the dots, yadda, yadda, yadda.
 Not only is this useful for graphing, but this methodology gives yet another way of identifying functions.
 If you can solve for  y   , then it s a function.
 In other words, if you can enter it into your graphing calculator, then it s a function.
 The calculator can only handle functions.
 For example, 2y   3x   6 is a function, because you can solve for y.
 2y   3x   6 2y    3x   6 y   x   3.

In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
 Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.

Some algebraic functions, however, cannot be expressed by such finite expressions .
 This is the case, for example, of the Bring radical, which is the function implicitly defined by.

A function which is not algebraic is called a transcendental function, as it is for example the case of exp   , tan   , ln   ,     displaystyle  exp, tan, ln, Gamma   .
 A composition of transcendental functions can give an algebraic function.
 f   cos       1   x 2   displaystyle f  cos    sqrt  1_x  2     .

A transcendental function is an analytic function that does not satisfy a polynomial equation, in contrast to an algebraic function.
  The polynomials sometimes must have rational coefficients.
  In other words, a transcendental function  transcends  algebra in that it cannot be expressed in terms of a finite sequence of the algebraic operations of addition, multiplication, and root extraction.

A function that is not transcendental is algebraic.
 Simple examples of algebraic functions are the rational functions and the square root function, but in general, algebraic functions cannot be defined as finite formulas of the elementary functions.

Colin McQuillan s answer is terse, correct, but difficult to understand for typographical reasons.
 There should be some letters below the arrows.
