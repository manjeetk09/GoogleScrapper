The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).

Reflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to "know" everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime. The code can be written against known interfaces, but the actual classes to be used can be instantiated using reflection from configuration files.

What is reflection, and why is it useful?
I'm particularly interested in Java, but I assume the principles are the same in any language.
The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).
For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.

So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :
One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.

And finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.

Reflection is a language's ability to inspect and dynamically call classes, methods, attributes, etc. at runtime.

For example, all objects in Java have the method getClass(), which lets you determine the object's class even if you don't know it at compile time (e.g. if you declared it as an Object) - this might seem trivial, but such reflection is not possible in less dynamic languages such as C++. More advanced uses lets you list and call methods, constructors, etc.

Lots of modern frameworks use reflection extensively for this very reason. Most other modern languages use reflection as well, and in scripting languages (such as Python) they are even more tightly integrated, since it feels more natural within the general programming model of those languages.

One of my favorite uses of reflection is the below Java dump method. It takes any object as a parameter and uses the Java reflection API print out every field name and value.

Not every language supports reflection but the principles are usually the same in languages that support it.
Reflection is the ability to "reflect" on the structure of your program. Or more concrete. To look at the objects and classes you have and programmatically get back information on the methods, fields, and interfaces they implement. You can also look at things like annotations.

It's usefull in a lot of situations. Everywhere you want to be able to dynamically plug in classes into your code. Lot's of object relational mappers use reflection to be able to instantiate objects from databases without knowing in advance what objects they're going to use. Plug-in architectures is another place where reflection is usefull. Being able to dynamically load code and determine if there are types there that implement the right interface to use as a plugin is important in those situations.

Reflection is a key mechanism to allow an application or framework to work with code that might not have even been written yet!
Take for example your typical web.xml file. This will contain a list of servlet elements, which contain nested servlet-class elements. The servlet container will process the web.xml file, and create new a new instance of each servlet class through reflection.

Uses of Reflection
Reflection is commonly used by programs which require the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java virtual machine. This is a relatively advanced feature and should be used only by developers who have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of the language. With that caveat in mind, reflection is a powerful technique and can enable applications to perform operations which would otherwise be impossible.

Extensibility Features
An application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names. Class Browsers and Visual Development Environments A class browser needs to be able to enumerate the members of classes. Visual development environments can benefit from making use of type information available in reflection to aid the developer in writing correct code. Debuggers and Test Tools Debuggers need to be able to examine private members on classes. Test harnesses can make use of reflection to systematically call a discoverable set APIs defined on a class, to insure a high level of code coverage in a test suite.

Drawbacks of Reflection
Reflection is powerful, but should not be used indiscriminately. If it is possible to perform an operation without using reflection, then it is preferable to avoid using it. The following concerns should be kept in mind when accessing code via reflection. Performance Overhead.

Because reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations can not be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications. Security Restrictions.

Since reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code, such as accessing private fields and methods, the use of reflection can result in unexpected side-effects, which may render code dysfunctional and may destroy portability. Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behavior with upgrades of the platform.

Reflection allows instantiation of new objects, invocation of methods, and get/set operations on class variables dynamically at run time without having prior knowledge of its implementation.
In above example the null parameter is the object you want to invoke the method on. If the method is static you supply null. If the method is not static, then while invoking you need to supply a valid MyObject instance instead of null.

Reflection also allows you to access private member/methods of a class:
Reflection is a very powerful API but it may slow down the application if used in excess, as it resolves all the types at runtime.
Example : Take for example a remote application which gives your application an object which you obtain using their API Methods . Now based on the object you might need to perform some sort of computation . The provider guarantees that object can be of 3 types and we need to perform computation based on what type of object . So we might implement in 3 classes each containing a different logic .Obviously the object information is available in runtime so you cannot statically code to perform computation hence reflection is used to instantiate the object of the class that you require to perform the computation based on the object received from the provider .

A quick Java Reflection example to show you what using reflection looks like:
This example obtains the Class object from the class called MyObject. Using the class object the example gets a list of the methods in that class, iterates the methods and print out their names.

Reflection allows programmer to access entities in program dynamically. i.e. while coding an application if programmer is unaware about a class or its methods, he can make use of such class dynamically (at run time) by using reflection.

It is frequently used in scenarios where a class name changes frequently. If such a situation arises, then it is complicated for the programmer to rewrite the application and change the name of the class again and again.

Instead, by using reflection, there is need to worry about a possibly changing class name.

Reflection is a set of functions which allows you to access the runtime information of your program and modify it behavior (with some limitations).
It's useful because it allows you to change the runtime behaivour depending on the meta information of your program, that is, you can check the return type of a function and change the way you handle the situation.
In C# for example you can load an assembly (a .dll) in runtime an examine it, navigating through the classes and taking actions according to what you found. It also let you create an instance of a class on runtime, invoke its method, etc.

With Reflection API you can write universal toString() method for any object.

Reflection itself is a word for such languages that lack capability of self-knowledge and self-sensing as Java and C#. Because they do not have the capability of self-knowledge, when we want to observe how it looks like, we must have another thing to reflect how it looks like. Excellent dynamic languages such as Ruby and Python can perceive the reflection of their own without the help of other individuals. We can say that the object of Java cannot perceive how it looks like without a mirror, which is an object of the reflection class, but object in Python can perceive it without a mirror. So that's why we need reflection in Java.

Because they do not have the capability of self-knowledge, when we want to observe how it looks like, we must have another thing to reflect how it looks like. Excellent dynamic languages such as Ruby and Python can perceive the reflection of their own without the help of other individuals. We can say that the object of Java cannot perceive how it looks like without a mirror, which is an object of the reflection class, but object in Python can perceive it without a mirror. So that's why we need reflection in Java.

Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behaviour of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.
The java.lang and java.lang.reflect packages provide classes for java reflection.

The java.lang and java.lang.reflect packages provide classes for java reflection.
Reflection can be used to get information about –
Class The getClass() method is used to get the name of the class to which an object belongs.
Constructors The getConstructors() method is used to get the public constructors of the class to which an object belongs.
Methods The getMethods() method is used to get the public methods of the class to which an objects belongs.
The Reflection API is mainly used in:
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) e.g. Eclipse, MyEclipse, NetBeans etc. Debugger and Test Tools etc.

Advantages of Using Reflection:
Extensibility Features: An application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names.

Drawbacks:
Performance Overhead: Reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.

Reflection gives you ability to write more generic code . It allows you to create object at runtime and call its method at runtime. Hence the program can be made higly parameterised. It also allow to introspect the object and class to detect its variables and method exposed to outer world.

As name itself suggest it reflects what it holds for example class method,etc apart from providing feature to invoke method creating instance dynamically at runtime.
It is used by many frameworks and application under the wood to invoke services without actually knowing the code.
Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time. Mostly at framework level the maximum benefits of reflection can be achieved. The byte code that is compiled if needs extra modification at run time for examination, modification, addition of more byte code within itself, or another program or another framework at method level, instance variable level, constructor level, annotation level reflection can be useful.

Suppose you have a method add(Int a,int b). The equivalent byte code is suppose B1. If suppose you have 1000 methods named add in your system. Now you want to check the value of parameter a and b before method add is called. So, you can glue your code to another program or framework that uses reflection to dynamically examine the byte code value using Object.getClass.getMethod(). There are several classes for examining. It can add more operation before method add is called. But, the program itself or another program or framework does not know about the object that has a method named add. Mostly in dependency injection, aspect oriented programming use of reflection is mostly used.

For inspection of classes (also know as introspection) you don't need to import the reflection package (java.lang.reflect). Class metadata can be accessed through java.lang.Class.

To give you a example how to use Reflection in a practical way:
Its said that most high-level dynamically types languages are reflexive. Reflection (computer programming) on Wikipedia explains but it doesn't really give a very clear picture of what it means. Can anyone explain it in a simpler way by a relevant example?

The following examples show an instance foo of a class Foo being created, and a method hello (or Hello) of the instance being called. For each language, two versions are shown; the first being a call sequence without reflection and the second using reflection to access the class and the method.

Type introspection is the ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime. Just as we mentioned in the intro, the types of questions you might want to ask are what type is this object, or is it an instance of a certain class. Some languages even allow you to traverse the inheritance hierarchy to see if your object is derived from an inherited base class. Several languages have the type introspection capability, such as Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, C++, and more. Overall, type introspection is a very simple concept to understand – and you can really write powerful logic when you can query some of the metadata about your objects. Below are some examples of type introspection in the wild:

If type introspection allows you to inspect an object’s attributes at runtime, then reflection is what allows you to manipulate those attributes at runtime. As a concrete definition, reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine and modify the structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) of a program at runtime. In layman’s terms, what this allows you to do is invoke a method on an object, instantiate a new object, or modify an attribute of an object – all without knowing the names of the interfaces, fields, methods at compile time. Because of the runtime-specific nature of reflection, it’s more difficult to implement reflection in a statically-typed language compared to a dynamically-typed language because type checking occurs at compile time in a statically-typed language instead of at runtime (you can read more about that in my post). However it is by no means impossible, as Java, C#, and other modern statically-typed languages allow for both type introspection and reflection (but not C++, which allows only type introspection and not reflection).
