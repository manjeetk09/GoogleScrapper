The graph of fin this example is the graph of y   x2 _ 3.
 It is easy to generate points on the graph.
 Choose a value for the first coordinate, then evaluate f at that number to find the second coordinate.
 The following table shows several values for x and the function f evaluated at those numbers.
f.
First we solve the equation for y.
Last we graph our matching x_ and y_values and draw a line.
Example.
We are going to graph the equation _4x 2y 2.
First we solve the equation for y.

Here is an example of a graph that is not a function.
For example, if you work in a fast food outlet, your pay packet depends on the number of hours you work.
 Or, the amount of concrete you need to order when constructing a building will depend on the height of the building.

 Graphs of Functions Defined by Tables of Data _ often we don t have an algebraic expression for a function, just tables.
In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
 Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.

.
The informal definition of an algebraic function provides a number of clues about their properties.
 To gain an intuitive understanding, it may be helpful to regard algebraic functions as functions which can be formed by the usual algebraic operations.
 addition, multiplication, division, and taking an nth root.
 This is something of an oversimplification  because of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, algebraic functions need not be expressible by radicals.
.
.
However, not every function has an inverse.
 For example, y   x2 fails the horizontal line test.
 it fails to be one_to_one.
 The inverse is the algebraic  function  x     y   displaystyle x  pm   sqrt  y    .
 Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve.
