The types of the database models generally used in the business organizations can be categorized as follows  .
There are three types of database models which are common in the industry.
  They are the Hierarchical Data Model, the Network Data Model and the Relational Data Model.
 These models have their own particular nature, and, therefore, they are applicable in the industry where a similar situation exists.
 There is fourth model known as the Object Data Based Model in which data is structured as objects at a much higher level as compared to the other models providing flexibility in designing the application.
Common logical data models for databases include.
 Hierarchical database model.
 Network model.
 Relational model.
 Entity relationship model Enhanced entity relationship model.
 Object model.
 Document model.
 Entity attribute value model.
 Star schema.
Enhanced.

A model is a representation of reality,  real world  objects and events, associations.
 It is an abstraction that concentrates on the essential, inherent aspects an organization and ignores the accidental properties.
 A data model represents the organization itself.
 It should provide the basic concepts and notations that will allow database designers and end users unambiguously and accurately to communicate their understanding of the organizational data.
Hierarchical Database model is one of the oldest database models, dating from late 1950s.
 One of the first hierarchical databases Information Management System was developed jointly by North American Rockwell Company and IBM.
 This model is like a structure of a tree with the records forming the nodes and fields forming the branches of the tree.

The tree structure has parts record superior to supplier record.
 That is parts form the parent and supplier forms the children.
 Each of the four trees figure, consists of one part record occurrence, together with a set of subordinate supplier record occurrences.
 There is one supplier record for each supplier of a particular part.
 Each supplier occurrence includes the corresponding shipment quantity.

A Database model defines the logical design of data.
 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.
 Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used.
 They are, Hierarchical Model.
 Network Model.
