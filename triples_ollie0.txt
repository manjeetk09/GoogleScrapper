Algorithms/Left_rotation: This shows how balancing is applied to establish a priority heap invariant in a Treap, a data structure which has the queueing performance of a heap, and the key lookup performance of a tree.
0.563: (the queueing performance of a heap; be has by; a data structure)

 A balancing operation can change the tree structure while maintaining another order, which is binary tree sort order.
0.808: (A balancing operation; can change; the tree structure)[enabler=while maintaining another order , which is binary tree sort order]
0.772: (another order; is binary; tree sort order)

 The binary tree order is left to right, with left nodes' keys less than right nodes' keys, whereas the priority order is up and down, with higher nodes' priorities greater than lower nodes' priorities.
0.58: (the priority order; is up down down with; higher nodes ' priorities)

 Alternatively, the priority can be viewed as another ordering key, except that finding a specific key is more involved.
0.869: (the priority; Alternatively can be viewed as; another ordering key)

There is a distinction between a tree as an abstract data type and as a concrete data structure, analogous to the distinction between a list and a linked list.
No extractions found.

 As a data type, a tree has a value and children, and the children are themselves trees; the value and children of the tree are interpreted as the value of the root node and the subtrees of the children of the root node.
0.937: (the value and children of the tree; are interpreted as; the value of the root node and the subtrees of the children of the root node)
0.688: (themselves; has a value as; a data type)
0.68: (a tree; has; a value and children)
0.613: (a tree; has a value as; a data type)
0.613: (the children; has a value as; a data type)
0.604: (themselves; has children as; a data type)
0.591: (themselves; has; a value and children)
0.523: (a tree; has children as; a data type)
0.523: (the children; has children as; a data type)
0.509: (the children; has; a value and children)

 To allow finite trees, one must either allow the list of children to be empty , or allow trees to be empty, in which case the list of children can be of fixed size , if desired.
0.851: (one; must either allow; the list of children)[enabler=if desired]
0.83: (the list of children; can be of; fixed size)

Some properties of abstract data types:.
No extractions found.

A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.
0.788: (A data structure; is said; linear)
0.156: (its elements; form; a sequence)

In these data structures each tree node compares a bit slice of key values.
0.825: (each tree node; compares; a bit slice of key values)
0.613: (each tree node; compares a bit slice of key values in; these data structures)

These are data structures used for space partitioning or binary space partitioning.

 Tree data structures have many things in common with their botanical cousins.
0.793: (Tree data structures; have; many things)
0.778: (Tree data structures; have many things in common with; their botanical cousins)

 A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves.
0.692: (A tree data structure; has; a root)

 The difference between a tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data structure has its root at the top and its leaves on the bottom.
0.755: (a tree data structure; has its root at; the top and its leaves)
0.584: (a tree data structure; has; its root)

Even though computers can perform literally millions of mathematical computations per second, when a problem gets large and complicated, performance can nonetheless be an important consideration.
0.751: (performance; can nonetheless be; an important consideration)
0.729: (computers; Even can perform literally; millions of mathematical computations)
0.614: (a problem; gets; large and complicated)

 One of the most crucial aspects to how quickly a problem can be solved is how the data is stored in memory.
0.82: (One of the most crucial aspects; to is is stored in; memory)
0.811: (the data; to is is stored in; memory)

 To illustrate this point, consider going to the local library to find a book about a specific subject matter.
No extractions found.

 Most likely, you will be able to use some kind of electronic reference or, in the worst case, a card catalog, to determine the title and author of the book you want.
0.83: (you; will be; able)
0.822: (you; to use; some kind of electronic reference)
0.668: (you; will be able in; the worst case)

 Since the books are typically shelved by category, and within each category sorted by author’s name, it is a fairly straightforward and painless process to then physically select your book from the shelves.
No extractions found.

 Now, suppose instead you came to the library in search of a particular book, but instead of organized shelves, were greeted with large garbage bags lining both sides of the room, each arbitrarily filled with books that may or may not have anything to do with one another.
0.903: (you; instead came to; the library)
0.898: (you; instead came in; search of a particular book)
0.183: (search of a particular book; instead came to; you)

 It would take hours, or even days, to find the book you needed, a comparative eternity.

 This is how software runs when data is not stored in an efficient format appropriate to the application.
0.925: (data; is not stored in; an efficient format appropriate)

 Simple Data Structures The simplest data structures are primitive variables.
No extractions found.

 They hold a single value, and beyond that, are of limited use.
0.913: (They; are of; limited use)
0.784: (They; hold; a single value)

 When many related values need to be stored, an array is used.
No extractions found.

 It is assumed that the reader of this article has a solid understanding of variables and arrays.
0.649: (the reader of this article; has; a solid understanding of variables)

 A somewhat more difficult concept, though equally primitive, are pointers.
No extractions found.

 Pointers, instead of holding an actual value, simply hold a memory address that, in theory, contains some useful piece of data.
0.771: (a memory address; contains some useful piece of data in; theory)
0.62: (some useful piece of data; be contains by; a memory address)

 Most seasoned C++ coders have a solid understanding of how to use pointers, and many of the caveats, while fledgling programmers may find themselves a bit spoiled by more modern "managed" languages which, for better or worse, handle pointers implicitly.
0.807: (Most seasoned C++ coders; have; a solid understanding how to use pointers)
0.73: (fledgling programmers; may find themselves; a bit spoiled by more modern "managed " languages)
0.421: (Most seasoned C++ coders; be many of; the caveats)

 Either way, it should suffice to know that pointers "point" somewhere in memory, and do not actually store data themselves.
0.553: (that pointers; "point; data)

 A less abstract way to think about pointers is in how the human mind remembers certain things.
0.772: (the human mind; remembers; certain things)

 Many times, a good engineer may not necessarily know a particular formula/constant/equation, but when asked, they could tell you exactly which reference to check.
0.668: (a good engineer; may not necessarily know; a particular formula/constant/equation)

 Arrays Arrays are a very simple data structure, and may be thought of as a list of a fixed length.
0.855: (Arrays Arrays; may be thought as; a list of a fixed length)

 Arrays are nice because of their simplicity, and are well suited for situations where the number of data items is known .
0.866: (Arrays; are well suited for; situations where the number of data items is known)
0.775: (Arrays; are nice because of; their simplicity)

 Suppose you need a piece of code to calculate the average of several numbers.
0.906: (you; need; a piece of code)
0.893: (you; need a piece of code to calculate; the average of several numbers)
0.88: (you; to calculate; the average of several numbers)

 An array is a perfect data structure to hold the individual values, since they have no specific order, and the required computations do not require any special handling other than to iterate through all of the values.
0.854: (a perfect data structure to hold the individual values , since they have no specific order , and the required computations; do not require; any special handling other)
0.711: (An array; is; a perfect data structure to hold the individual values , since they have no specific order , and the required computations)
0.681: (they; have; no specific order)

 The other big strength of arrays is that they can be accessed randomly, by index.
0.878: (they; can be accessed randomly by; index)

 For instance, if you have an array containing a list of names of students seated in a classroom, where each seat is numbered 1 through n, then studentName is a trivial way to read or store the name of the student in seat i.
0.892: (each seat; is numbered 1 through; n)
0.776: (each seat; is numbered; 1)
0.753: (students; be seated in; a classroom where each seat is numbered 1 through n)
0.564: (each seat; is numbered 1 in; a classroom)
0.23: (you; have; an array containing a list of names of students)

 An array might also be thought of as a pre_bound pad of paper.
0.924: (An array; might also be thought as; a pre_bound pad of paper)

 It has a fixed number of pages, each page holds information, and is in a predefined location that never changes.
0.838: (each page; is in; a predefined location that never changes)
0.691: (It; has of; pages)[attrib=each page holds information]

 Linked Lists A linked list is a data structure that can hold an arbitrary number of data items, and can easily change size to add or remove items.
0.742: (A linked list; is; a data structure that can hold an arbitrary number of data items)

 A linked list, at its simplest, is a pointer to a data node.
0.932: (A linked list; is a pointer to; a data node)
0.788: (A linked list; is; a pointer)
0.651: (a pointer; be A linked list at; its simplest)

 Each data node is then composed of data , and a pointer to the next node.
0.916: (Each data node; is then composed of; data)

 At the end of the list, the pointer is set to null.
