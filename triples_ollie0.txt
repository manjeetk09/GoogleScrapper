There are various types of algebraic functions.
No extractions found.

There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
No extractions found.

 Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0.564: (the graphs; be produces by; its own type of function)

 They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0.796: (you; can get; an idea what a graph might look like)

 The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
No extractions found.

Different types of graphs depend on the type of function that is graphed.
0.864: (Different types of graphs; depend on; the type of function that is graphed)

 The eight most commonly used graphs are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
No extractions found.

 Each has a unique graph that is easy to visually differentiate from the rest.
