A Database model defines the logical design of data.

 The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data.

Database systems can be based on different data models or database models respectively.
0.9: (Database systems; can be based on; different data models or database models)

 A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database.
0.939: (A data model; is a collection of; concepts and rules)
0.922: (A data model; is a collection of concepts for; the description of the structure of the database)
0.736: (A data model; is; a collection of concepts)

 Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively.

 Data Models are fundamental entities to introduce abstraction in a DBMS.

  Entity_Relationship.

The Entity_Relationship model has emerged as one of the main techniques for modeling database design and forms the basis for the database design methodology.
0.889: (The Entity_Relationship model; has emerged as; one of the main techniques)

 The object oriented data model extends the definition of an entity to include, not only the attributes that describe the state of the object but also the actions that are associated with the object, that is, its behavior.
0.846: (data model; extends; the definition of an entity)

 The object is said to encapsulate both state and behavior.
0.761: (The object; to encapsulate; state and behavior)

 Entities in semantic systems represent the equivalent of a record in a relational system or an object in an OO system but they do not include behaviour .
