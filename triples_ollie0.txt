Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset  to make predictions.
0.962: (Supervised learning; is a type of; machine learning algorithm that uses a known dataset to make predictions)
0.768: (Supervised learning; is; a type of machine learning algorithm)
0.62: (a known dataset; be uses by; machine learning algorithm)

 The training dataset includes input data and response values.
0.782: (The training dataset; includes; input data and response values)

 From it, the supervised learning algorithm seeks to build a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset.
0.803: (the supervised learning algorithm; seeks to build; a model that can make predictions of the response values for a new dataset)
0.708: (predictions of the response values; can be make for; a new dataset)
0.456: (the supervised learning algorithm; seeks from; it)

 A test dataset is often used to validate the model.
0.761: (A test dataset; to validate; the model)

 Using larger training datasets often yield models with higher predictive power that can generalize well for new datasets.
0.762: (larger training datasets; often yield; models)
