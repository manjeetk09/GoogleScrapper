1;In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation
1; Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power
1;Examples of such functions are
1; f   1   x   displaystyle f 1 x 
1; f   x   displaystyle f   sqrt  x   
1; f   1   x 3 x 3   7   7 x 1   3   displaystyle f   frac   sqrt  1 x  3    x  3 7 _  sqrt  7  x  1 3    
1; This is the case, for example, of the Bring radical, which is the function implicitly defined by
1;where the coefficients aiare polynomial functions of x, with coefficients belonging to a set S
1;where the coefficients aiare polynomial functions of x, with coefficients belonging to a set S
1;A function which is not algebraic is called a transcendental function, as it is for example the case of exp   , tan   , ln   ,     displaystyle  exp, tan, ln, Gamma   
1;A function which is not algebraic is called a transcendental function, as it is for example the case of exp   , tan   , ln   ,     displaystyle  exp, tan, ln, Gamma   
1; A composition of transcendental functions can give an algebraic function
1; f   cos       1   x 2   displaystyle f  cos    sqrt  1_x  2     
1;As an equation of degree n has n roots, a polynomial equation does not implicitly define a single function, but n functions, sometimes also called branches
1; Consider for example the equation of the unit circle
1; y 2   x 2   1
1;   displaystyle y  2  x  2  1
1; ,  This determines y, except only up to an overall sign  accordingly, it has two branches
1; y     1   x 2 
1;   displaystyle y  pm   sqrt  1_x  2   
1; , 
1;An algebraic function in m variables is similarly defined as a function y which solves a polynomial equation in m   1 variables
1;,xm

1; addition, multiplication, division, and taking an nth root
1; This is something of an oversimplification  because of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, algebraic functions need not be expressible by radicals
1;First, note that any polynomial function y   p   displaystyle y p  is an algebraic function, since it is simply the solution y to the equation
1;More generally, any rational function y   p q   displaystyle y   frac  p  q    is algebraic, being the solution to
1;Moreover, the nth root of any polynomial y   p n   displaystyle y   sqrt p    is an algebraic function, solving the equation
1; For supposing that y is a solution to
1; Indeed, interchanging the roles of x and y and gathering terms,
1;Writing x as a function of y gives the inverse function, also an algebraic function
1; For example, y   x2 fails the horizontal line test
1; it fails to be one_to_one
1; The inverse is the algebraic  function  x     y   displaystyle x  pm   sqrt  y    
1; Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve
1; Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve
1; Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve
1; Hence any polynomial relation p  0 is guaranteed to have at least one solution for y at each point x, provided we allow y to assume complex as well as real values
1; Thus, problems to do with the domain of an algebraic function can safely be minimized
1;Furthermore, even if one is ultimately interested in real algebraic functions, there may be no means to express the function in terms of addition, multiplication, division and taking nth roots without resorting to complex numbers 
1;Furthermore, even if one is ultimately interested in real algebraic functions, there may be no means to express the function in terms of addition, multiplication, division and taking nth roots without resorting to complex numbers 
1; For example, consider the algebraic function determined by the equation
1;Using the cubic formula, we get
1;For x   3 4 3 ,   displaystyle x leq   frac  3   sqrt 4   ,  the square root is real and the cubic root is thus well defined, providing the unique real root
1; On the other hand, for x   3 4 3 ,   displaystyle x   frac  3   sqrt 4   ,  the square root is not real, and one has to choose, for the square root, either non_real square root
1; On the other hand, for x   3 4 3 ,   displaystyle x   frac  3   sqrt 4   ,  the square root is not real, and one has to choose, for the square root, either non_real square root
1; Thus the cubic root has to be chosen among three non_real numbers
1; If the same choices are done in the two terms of the formula, the three choices for the cubic root provide the three branches shown, in the accompanying image

1;On a more significant theoretical level, using complex numbers allows one to use the powerful techniques of complex analysis to discuss algebraic functions
1; In particular, the argument principle can be used to show that any algebraic function is in fact an analytic function, at least in the multiple_valued sense

1;Formally, let pbe a complex polynomial in the complex variables x and y
1; Suppose that x0   C is such that the polynomial pof y has n distinct zeros
1; Suppose that x0   C is such that the polynomial pof y has n distinct zeros
1; Suppose that x0   C is such that the polynomial pof y has n distinct zeros
1; We shall show that the algebraic function is analytic in a neighborhood of x0
1; Choose a system of n non_overlapping discs  i containing each of these zeros
1; Then by the argument principle
1;By continuity, this also holds for all x in a neighborhood of x0
1; In particular, phas only one root in  i, given by the residue theorem
1;which is an analytic function
1;Note that the foregoing proof of analyticity derived an expression for a system of n different function elements fi, provided that x is not a critical point of p
1;Note that the foregoing proof of analyticity derived an expression for a system of n different function elements fi, provided that x is not a critical point of p
1; A critical point is a point where the number of distinct zeros is smaller than the degree of p, and this occurs only where the highest degree term of p vanishes, and where the discriminant vanishes
1; A critical point is a point where the number of distinct zeros is smaller than the degree of p, and this occurs only where the highest degree term of p vanishes, and where the discriminant vanishes
1; Hence there are only finitely many such points c1,

1;Note that, away from the critical points, we have
1;since the fi are by definition the distinct zeros of p
1;since the fi are by definition the distinct zeros of p
1;  The monodromy action on the universal covering space is related but different notion in the theory of Riemann surfaces

1;The ideas surrounding algebraic functions go back at least as far as Ren  Descartes

1;An algebraic function is a function that involves only algebraic operations, like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as fractional or rational exponents
1; Think of an algebraic function as a machine, where real numbers go in, mathematical operations occur, and other numbers come out
1;We call the numbers going into an algebraic function the input, x, or the domain
1;We call the numbers going into an algebraic function the input, x, or the domain
1; We call the numbers coming out of a function the output, y, or the range
1; Remember, one value in, one value out
1;There are many different types of algebraic functions
1; linear, quadratic, cubic, polynomial, rational, and radical equations
1; In this next part of the lesson, we ll learn about a couple of different methods we can use to identify them
1; Sometimes functions multiply the domain to get the range, like 3x
1; Functions may also subtract or divide the domain or use a combination of operations to produce the range
1; As long as the rule of  one in one out  is kept in place, the function exists
1;If an algebraic function says to add two to the domain, we can create a table to show the function
1;As you can see, for every domain, we have one range
1; These pairs of x values_ and y_values are called ordered pairs because we put them in order 
1; These pairs of x values_ and y_values are called ordered pairs because we put them in order 
1;We can also turn our table into ordered pairs to show a function
1; , , and where there is one x_value for every one y_value
1;We can also use graphs to identify functions by plotting ordered pairs onto a Cartesian Coordinate System, where the x_values are on the horizontal line and the y_values are on the vertical line

1;We can also use graphs to identify functions by plotting ordered pairs onto a Cartesian Coordinate System, where the x_values are on the horizontal line and the y_values are on the vertical line
1; Where the ordered pairs meet is where the point is graphed
1; If we plot the points, we end up with a straight line, so the function, x   2, is considered a linear function and can be written in functional notation as f  x   2

1; The fis just another way to write y, which we call the f_function
1; It is a way for us to identify the different functions, instead of calling them all y   
1;We know a graph is a function if it can pass the vertical line test
1;We know a graph is a function if it can pass the vertical line test
1; If a vertical line crosses in two places on a graph, it is in conflict with the one in, one out rule
1; So, it is not a function
1;Here is an example of a graph that is not a function

1;The quadratic function
1; g  x 2 _ 3
1; First, let s create a table

1; Did you notice how we repeated some of the range values  Is this acceptable  YES, because each ordered pair has one x_value and one y_value
1; Did you notice how we repeated some of the range values  Is this acceptable  YES, because each ordered pair has one x_value and one y_value
1; The y_values can be repeated as long as the x_values are not repeated
1;Now let s graph this function and use the vertical line test to make sure we still have an algebraic function
