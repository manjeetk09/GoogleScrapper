0;In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables.
0; More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.

0;Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs connected by some points sometimes called  remarkable points .
0; A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis.
0; In each direction, an arc is either unbounded or has an end point which is either a singular point or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

0;This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the  complete  curve.
0; This point of view is commonly expressed by calling  points at infinity  of the affine curve the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.

0;There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
0; Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0; They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0; The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
0;These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves.
0; The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.
0;The following table lists the names of algebraic curves of a given degree.
0;The simplest and clearest concept is that of a plane affine algebraic curve.
0; This is a set of points in an affine plane satisfying the equation , where is a polynomial with coefficients from an algebraically closed field .
0; The field of rational functions of an irreducible algebraic curve over is the field of algebraic functions in one variable of the form , where and are connected by the equation , where is a polynomial over .
0; This means that every algebraic curve is birationally isomorphic to a plane affine curve.
0;For any complete algebraic curve , the number is known as the arithmetic genus of the algebraic curve .
0; If is smooth, is identical with the dimension of the space of all regular differential forms on   this dimension is known as the genus of .
0; By definition, the genus of an algebraic curve is equal to the genus of its non_singular model.
0; For any non_negative integer there exists an algebraic curve of genus .
0; Rational curves are distinguished by the equality .
0; If is a projective plane curve of order , then.
0;The problem of classifying smooth projective curves of a given type can be reduced to the study of discrete groups of transformations of the universal coverings which act freely with a relatively compact fundamental domain.
0; In the case of the projective line, is the identity group  in the case of the affine straight line, is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group which is a two_dimensional lattice in   in the case of the interior of the unit disc, is a subgroup of motions in the Lobachevskii plane which can be defined by some non_Euclidean bounded polygon.
0; Thus, the first class above contains a unique curve , the second class consists of complex tori that all have the structure of a one_dimensional Abelian variety , the addition of points on the torus defining the group structure on the respective curve.
0; All smooth elliptic curves are obtained in this way.
0; The field of rational functions on an elliptic curve is isomorphic to the field of meromorphic doubly_periodic functions with period group .
0; If is the equation of the affine model of the curve , then there exists a parametrization , by elliptic functions of it .
0; The third class consists of all smooth projective curves of genus .
0; In this case the field is isomorphic to the field of meromorphic functions on that are invariant with respect to the group .
0; Such functions are known as automorphic.
0; Every algebraic curve of genus is uniformized by automorphic functions  cf.
0; Uniformization .
0; The problem of the classification of elliptic curves also led to a study of the quotient , but this situation is substantially different from the one just discussed.
0; First, the group has fixed points in   secondly, the manifold is non_compact, though containing a finite Lobachevskii plane.
0; The study of the general case of such groups, and of the respective quotients, plays an important role in modern arithmetical research.
