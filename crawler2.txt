1; The most popular example of a database model is the relational model, which uses a table_based format

1;Common logical data models for databases include
1; Hierarchical database model
1; Network model
1; Relational model
1; Entity relationship model Enhanced entity relationship model
1; Object model
1; Document model
1; Entity attribute value model
1; Star schema
1;An object_relational database combines the two related structures
1;Physical data models include
1; Inverted index
1; Flat file
1;Other models include
1; Associative model
1; Correlational model
1; Multidimensional model
1; Multivalue model
1; Semantic model

1;A given database management system may provide one or more models
1; The optimal structure depends on the natural organization of the application s data, and on the application s requirements, which include transaction rate , reliability, maintainability, scalability, and cost
1; Most database management systems are built around one particular data model, although it is possible for products to offer support for more than one model
1;Various physical data models can implement any given logical model
1; Most database software will offer the user some level of control in tuning the physical implementation, since the choices that are made have a significant effect on performance
1;A model is not just a way of structuring data
1; The relational model, for example, defines operations such as select and join
1; Although these operations may not be explicit in a particular query language, they provide the foundation on which a query language is built

1;The flat model consists of a single, two_dimensional array of data elements, where all members of a given column are assumed to be similar values, and all members of a row are assumed to be related to one another

1; For instance, columns for name and password that might be used as a part of a system security database
1; Each row would have the specific password associated with an individual user
1; This tabular format is a precursor to the relational model
1;These models were popular in the 1960s, 1970s, but nowadays can be found primarily in old legacy systems
1; They are characterized primarily by being navigational with strong connections between their logical and physical representations, and deficiencies in data independence
1;In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree_like structure, implying a single parent for each record
1;In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree_like structure, implying a single parent for each record
1; A sort field keeps sibling records in a particular order
1; Hierarchical structures were widely used in the early mainframe database management systems, such as the Information Management System by IBM, and now describe the structure of XML documents
1; This structure allows one one_to_many relationship between two types of data
1; This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world  recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs verses, any nested and sorted information

1;This hierarchy is used as the physical order of records in storage
1; Such limitations have been compensated for in later IMS versions by additional logical hierarchies imposed on the base physical hierarchy
1;The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing many_to_many relationships in a tree_like structure that allows multiple parents
1; It was most popular before being replaced by the relational model, and is defined by the CODASYL specification

1;The network model organizes data using two fundamental concepts, called records and sets
1; Records contain fields 
1; Sets define one_to_many relationships between records
1; one owner, many members
1; A record may be an owner in any number of sets, and a member in any number of sets
1;g
1;, type A is the owner of B
1; At the same time another set may be defined where B is the owner of A
1; Thus all the sets comprise a general directed graph , or network construct
1; Access to records is either sequential or by navigation in the circular linked lists
1;The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
1;The network model is able to represent redundancy in data more efficiently than in the hierarchical model, and there can be more than one path from an ancestor node to a descendant
1; a program maintains a current position, and navigates from one record to another by following the relationships in which the record participates
1; Records can also be located by supplying key values
1;Although it is not an essential feature of the model, network databases generally implement the set relationships by means of pointers that directly address the location of a record on disk
1; This gives excellent retrieval performance, at the expense of operations such as database loading and reorganization
1;Popular DBMS products that utilized it were Cincom Systems  Total and Cullinet s IDMS
1; IDMS gained a considerable customer base  in the 1980s, it adopted the relational model and SQL in addition to its original tools and languages

1;Most object databases use the navigational concept to provide fast navigation across networks of objects, generally using object identifiers as  smart  pointers to related objects
1;In an inverted file or inverted index, the contents of the data are used as keys in a lookup table, and the values in the table are pointers to the location of each instance of a given content item

1; The inverted file data model can put indexes in a second set of files next to existing flat database files, in order to efficiently directly access needed records in these files
