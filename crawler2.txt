A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree_like structure.
 The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links.
 A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value.
 The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.
A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row in the relational database model and an entity type corresponds to a table .
The hierarchical database model mandates that each child record has only one parent, whereas each parent record can have one or more child records.
 In order to retrieve data from a hierarchical database the whole tree needs to be traversed starting from the root node.
 This model is recognized as the first database model created by IBM in the 1960s.

The hierarchical structure was developed by IBM in the 1960s, and used in early mainframe DBMS.
 Records  relationships form a treelike model.
 This structure is simple but inflexible because the relationship is confined to a one_to_many relationship.
 The IBM Information Management System and the RDM Mobile are examples of a hierarchical database system with multiple hierarchies over the same data.
 RDM Mobile is a newly designed embedded database for a mobile computer system.
The hierarchical data model lost traction as Codd s relational model became the de facto standard used by virtually all mainstream database management systems.
 A relational_database implementation of a hierarchical model was first discussed in published form in 1992 .
 Hierarchical data organization schemes resurfaced with the advent of XML in the late 1990s .
 The hierarchical structure is used primarily today for storing geographic information and file systems.
Currently hierarchical databases are still widely used especially in applications that require very high performance and availability such as banking and telecommunications.
 One of the most widely used commercial hierarchical databases is IMS.
 Another example of the use of hierarchical databases is Windows Registry in the Microsoft Windows operating systems.
An organization could store employee information in a table that contains attributes columns such as employee number, first name, last name, and department number.
 The organization provides each employee with computer hardware as needed, but computer equipment may only be used by the employee to which it is assigned.
 The organization could store the computer hardware information in a separate table that includes each part s serial number, type, and the employee that uses it.
 The tables might look like this .
In this model, the employee data table represents the  parent  part of the hierarchy, while the computer table represents the  child  part of the hierarchy.
 In contrast to tree structures usually found in computer software algorithms, in this model the children point to the parents.
 As shown, each employee may possess several pieces of computer equipment, but each individual piece of computer equipment may have only one employee owner.
Consider the following structure .
In this, the  child  is the same type as the  parent .
 The hierarchy stating EmpNo 10 is boss of 20, and 30 and 40 each report to 20 is represented by the  ReportsTo  column.
 In Relational database terms, the ReportsTo column is a foreign key referencing the EmpNo column.
 If the  child  data type were different, it would be in a different table, but there would still be a foreign key referencing the EmpNo column of the employees table.
This simple model is commonly known as the adjacency list model, and was introduced by Dr.
 Edgar F.
 Codd after initial criticisms surfaced that the relational model could not model hierarchical data.

This model is the oldest database model and is regarded as the first major influence on database modelling.

In the 1960 s North American Rockwell together with IBM developed a database processing language called DL I    This partnership also produced the IMS which went on to become the world s leading mainframe hierarchical DBMS of the seventies and eighties .
IMS uses DL I to process its database .
DL I uses hierarchies to represent relationships .

The hierarchical model was the first database model developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional file system.
  Hierarchical databases were predominantly used for transaction processing where the volume of transactions is large and the transaction operations change little over time.
  For example, the hierarchical database model was particularly popular with banks, because, the way in which banks process savings transactions seldom varies.

Hierarchical database model is a structure of data organized in a tree_like model using parent child like relationships, therefore there won t be too many relationships.
 In a hierarchical database, an entity type can be either a parent or a child  under each individual entity is is more multiple entities.
 Entity types are related to each other using tree mapping, which is represented by one parent with many child relationships.
 There are also attributes of a specific data recorded under an entity.

The tree like structure can be repeated data, usually with many children under single parent information.
 Data is a series of records, which have a set of values within it.
 All of the collected data is recorded in each type.
 These types are equal to the tables in other database model, and each parent or child is the equivalent of a row or column in a database table.
 In a hierarchical model, Parent Child relationships are all link together by certain types of data in a category.
 The links are mapped in the relationships so it would look like a tree structure with many branches sprouting form many branches.
 For example, a company will store information about an employee.
 So in the beginning of the tree will be the employee name.
 Below the name will be the data of the employee s number, department, salary, etc.
 Information such as birthday, children, and age will be stored also.
