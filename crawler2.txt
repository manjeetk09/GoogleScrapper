0;In mathematics, a plane real algebraic curve is the set of points on the Euclidean plane whose coordinates are zeros of some polynomial in two variables.
0; More generally an algebraic curve is similar but may be embedded in a higher dimensional space or defined over some more general field.

0;Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs connected by some points sometimes called  remarkable points .
0; A smooth monotone arc is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the x_axis.
0; In each direction, an arc is either unbounded or has an end point which is either a singular point or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

0;This allows to consider that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curve, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the  complete  curve.
0; This point of view is commonly expressed by calling  points at infinity  of the affine curve the points of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.

0;There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
0; Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
0; They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
0; The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
0;These functions produce more interesting graphs with more curves.
0; The highest power of the function tells you how many curves or ups and downs the graph may have.
0;Algebra is all about graphing relationships, and the curve is one of the most basic shapes used.
0; Here s a look at eight of the most frequently used graphs.
