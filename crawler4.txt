0;For example, the following is the hierarchical schema of a company database.
0;Sample Hierarchical Model Diagram.
0;The hierarchical model was the first database model developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional file system.
0;  Hierarchical databases were predominantly used for transaction processing where the volume of transactions is large and the transaction operations change little over time.
0;  For example, the hierarchical database model was particularly popular with banks, because, the way in which banks process savings transactions seldom varies.
0; .
0;    .
0;    .
0;The earliest model was the hierarchical database model, resembling an upside_down tree.
0; Files are related in a parent_child manner, with each parent capable of relating to more than one child, but each child only being related to one parent.
0; Most of you will be familiar with this kind of structure it s the way most file systems work.
0; There is usually a root, or top_level, directory that contains various other directories and files.
0; Each subdirectory can then contain more files and directories, and so on.
0; Each file or directory can only exist in one directory itself it only has one parent.
0; As you can see in the image below A1 is the root directory, and its children are B1 and B2.
0; B1 is a parent to C1, C2, and C3, which in turn has children of its own.
0;.
0;.
0;.
0;This model, although being a vast improvement on dealing with unrelated files, has some serious disadvantages.
0; It represents one_to_many relationships well , but it has problems with many_to_many relationships.
0; Relationships such as that between a product file and an orders file are difficult to implement in a hierarchical model.
0; Specifically, an order can contain many products, and a product can appear in many orders.
0; Also, the hierarchal model is not flexible because adding new relationships can result in wholesale changes to the existing structure, which in turn means all existing applications need to change as well.
0; This is not fun when someone has forgotten a table and wants it added to the system shortly before the project is due to launch  And developing the applications is complex because the programmer needs to know the data structure well in order to traverse the model to access the needed data.
0; As you ve seen in the earlier chapters, when accessing data from two related tables, you only need to know the fields you require from those two tables.
0; In the hierarchical model, you d need to know the entire chain between the two.
0; For example, to relate data from A1 and D4, you d need to take the route.
0; A1, B1, C3 and D4.

0;Hierarchical database model is a structure of data organized in a tree_like model using parent child like relationships, therefore there won t be too many relationships.
0; In a hierarchical database, an entity type can be either a parent or a child  under each individual entity is is more multiple entities.
0; Entity types are related to each other using tree mapping, which is represented by one parent with many child relationships.
0; There are also attributes of a specific data recorded under an entity.
0; .
0;The tree like structure can be repeated data, usually with many children under single parent information.
0; Data is a series of records, which have a set of values within it.
0; All of the collected data is recorded in each type.
0; These types are equal to the tables in other database model, and each parent or child is the equivalent of a row or column in a database table.
0; In a hierarchical model, Parent Child relationships are all link together by certain types of data in a category.
0; The links are mapped in the relationships so it would look like a tree structure with many branches sprouting form many branches.
0; For example, a company will store information about an employee.
0; So in the beginning of the tree will be the employee name.
0; Below the name will be the data of the employee s number, department, salary, etc.
0; Information such as birthday, children, and age will be stored also.
