See this post for all applications of Depth First Traversal.
 Following are implementations of simple Depth First Traversal.
 The C++ implementation uses adjacency list representation of graphs.
 STL‘s list container is used to store lists of adjacent nodes.
The C++ implementation uses adjacency list representation of graphs.
 STL‘s list container is used to store lists of adjacent nodes and queue of nodes needed for BFS traversal.
