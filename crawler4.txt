0;A function is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic operations on polynomials.
0;Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function.

0;Think of all the graphing that you ve done so far.
0; The simplest method is to solve for  y   , make a T_chart, pick some values for x, solve for the corresponding values of y, plot your points, and connect the dots, yadda, yadda, yadda.
0; Not only is this useful for graphing, but this methodology gives yet another way of identifying functions.
0; If you can solve for  y   , then it s a function.
0; In other words, if you can enter it into your graphing calculator, then it s a function.
0; The calculator can only handle functions.
0; For example, 2y   3x   6 is a function, because you can solve for y.
0; 2y   3x   6 2y    3x   6 y   x   3.

0;In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
0; Quite often algebraic functions can be expressed using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power.

0;Some algebraic functions, however, cannot be expressed by such finite expressions .
0; This is the case, for example, of the Bring radical, which is the function implicitly defined by.

0;A function which is not algebraic is called a transcendental function, as it is for example the case of exp   , tan   , ln   ,     displaystyle  exp, tan, ln, Gamma   .
0; A composition of transcendental functions can give an algebraic function.
0; f   cos       1   x 2   displaystyle f  cos    sqrt  1_x  2     .

0;A transcendental function is an analytic function that does not satisfy a polynomial equation, in contrast to an algebraic function.
0;  The polynomials sometimes must have rational coefficients.
0;  In other words, a transcendental function  transcends  algebra in that it cannot be expressed in terms of a finite sequence of the algebraic operations of addition, multiplication, and root extraction.

0;A function that is not transcendental is algebraic.
0; Simple examples of algebraic functions are the rational functions and the square root function, but in general, algebraic functions cannot be defined as finite formulas of the elementary functions.

0;Colin McQuillan s answer is terse, correct, but difficult to understand for typographical reasons.
0; There should be some letters below the arrows.
