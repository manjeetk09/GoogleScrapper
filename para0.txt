Specially, for CNE algorithm, we define a class CNE, where details are inside mlpack/src/mlpack/methods/ne/cne.hpp . For each algorithm, including CNE, NEAT and HyperNEAT, there are same key functions (with different implementation), so that different algorithms can be called in similar style. Here we list some key functions:

There are several options available for the algorithm used for each Lloyd iteration, specified with the --algorithm (-a) option. The standard O(kN) approach can be used (’naive’). Other options include the Pelleg-Moore tree-based algorithm (’pelleg-moore’), Elkan’s triangle-inequality based algorithm (’elkan’), and Hamerly’s modification to Elkan’s algorithm (’hamerly’).

These are a list of ideas compiled by mlpack developers; they range from simpler code maintenance tasks to difficult machine learning algorithm implementation, which means that there are suitable ideas for a wide range of student abilities and interests. The "necessary knowledge" sections can often be replaced with "willing to learn" for the easier projects, and for some of the more difficult problems, a full understanding of the description statement and some coding knowledge is sufficient.

This last goal is somewhat in contrast to the scikit-learn project, which generally only implements stable, well-known algorithms. mlpack can fill a niche by providing high-quality implementations of algorithms that just appeared in conferences or journals. In those cases where mlpack is implementing well-known algorithms (i.e. SVMs or other standard techniques), we should strive to ensure that our implementation is faster than other implementations. To ensure that, we may use the automatic benchmarking system; see https://www.github.com/zoq/benchmarks/.
