There are many kinds of data models. Some of the most common ones include: Hierarchical database model. Relational model. Network model. Object-oriented database model. Entity-relationship model. Document model. Entity-attribute-value model. Star schema. The object-relational model, which combines the two that make up its name.

A Database model defines the logical design of data. The model describes the relationships between different parts of the data. Historically, in database design, three models are commonly used. They are, Hierarchical Model. Network Model. Relational Model.

High-level Conceptual Data models

Database systems can be based on different data models or database models respectively. A data model is a collection of concepts and rules for the description of the structure of the database. Structure of the database means the data types, the constraints and the relationships for the description or storage of data respectively. The most often used data models are:

• Entity-Relationship
The Entity-Relationship model has emerged as one of the main techniques for modeling database design and forms the basis for the database design methodology. The object oriented data model extends the definition of an entity to include, not only the attributes that describe the state of the object but also the actions that are associated with the object, that is, its behavior. The object is said to encapsulate both state and behavior. Entities in semantic systems represent the equivalent of a record in a relational system or an object in an OO system but they do not include behaviour (methods). They are abstractions 'used to represent real world (e.g. customer) or conceptual (e.g. bank account) objects. The functional data model is now almost twenty years old. The original idea was to' view the database as a collection of extensionally defined functions and to use a functional language for querying the database.
