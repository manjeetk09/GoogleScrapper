Many Eclipse perspectives, e.g. the Java Development Tools (JDT), provide a debugger front-end. Allinea DDT - a graphical debugger supporting for parallel/multi-process and multithreaded applications, for C++/C++ and F90. DDD is the standard front-end from the GNU Project. It is a complex tool that works with most common debuggers (GDB, jdb, Python debugger, Perl debugger, Tcl, and others) natively or with some external programs (for PHP). GDB (the GNU debugger) GUI Emacs — Emacs editor with built-in support for the GNU Debugger acts as the frontend. KDbg — Part of the KDE development tools. Nemiver — A GDB frontend that integrates well in the GNOME desktop environment. xxgdb — X-window frontend for GDB and dbx debugger. Qt Creator — multi-platform frontend for GDB, CDB and LLDB. Allinea's DDT — a parallel and distributed front-end to a modified version of GDB. Xcode — contains a GDB front-end as well. SlickEdit — contains a GDB front-end as well. Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools (CDT) — includes visual debugging tools based on GDB. CodeLite — An open source, cross platform C/C++ IDE which have front end for gdb, the next version of CodeLite (v6.0) will also include a front end to the LLDB (debugger) CodeBlocks — A free cross-platform C, C++ and Fortran IDE with a front end for gdb. RR — An open source C/C++ debugger by Mozilla, supporting reproduction of program state and reverse execution

Using print statements for debugging a program is often not adequate or convenient. For example, the programmer may want to change the values of certain variables (or parameters) after observing the execution of the program till some point. For a large program it may be difficult to go back to the source program, make the necessary changes (maybe temporarily) and rerun the program. Again, if such print statements are placed inside loops, it will produce output everytime the loop is executed though the programmer may be interested in only certain iterations of the loop. To overcome several such drawbacks of debugging by inserting extra statements in the program, there are a kind of tool called debugger that helps in debugging programs by giving the programmer some control over the execution of the program and some means of examining and modifying different program variables during runtime.
