A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs (the "target" program). The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator (ISS), a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate (or the same) processor. Some debuggers offer two modes of operation - full or partial simulation, to limit this impact.

A "crash" happens when the program cannot normally continue because of a programming bug. For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory. When the program "crashes" or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the position in the original code if it is a source-level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly now seen in integrated development environments. If it is a low-level debugger or a machine-language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly (unless it also has online access to the original source code and can display the appropriate section of code from the assembly or compilation).

The following example uses the .foreach token to search for WORD values of 5a4d. For each 5a4d value that is found, the debugger displays 8 DWORD values, starting at the address of where the 5a4d DWORD was found.

Here is a step-by-step Hardware Debugger Example.
First you have to write a program. We will show how the Hardware Debugger works using this example :

This is the first part in a series of articles on how debuggers work. I'm still not sure how many articles the series will contain and what topics it will cover, but I'm going to start with the basics.

I'm now going to develop an example of running a process in "traced" mode in which we're going to single-step through its code - the machine code (assembly instructions) that's executed by the CPU. I'll show the example code in parts, explaining each, and in the end of the article you will find a link to download a complete C file that you can compile, execute and play with.
