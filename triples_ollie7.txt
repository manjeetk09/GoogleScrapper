Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way.
0.739: (operations; can be perform on; these data)
0.719: (Data Structure; is; a way collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way)
0.694: (we; can perform operations on; these data)
0.606: (we; can perform; operations)

 Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage.
0.696: (data elements; be rendering in; terms of some relationship)

 For example, we have data player s name  Virat  and age 26.
0.728: (data player; s; name Virat and age 26)
0.186: (we; have for; example)

 Here  Virat  is of String data type and 26 is of integer data type.
0.871: (26; is of; integer data type)
0.855: (Virat; is of; String data type)
