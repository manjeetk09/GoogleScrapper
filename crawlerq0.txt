There are various types of algebraic functions.
There are eight types of graphs that you will see more often than other types.
 Each has its own type of function that produces the graphs.
 They are easy to visually distinguish and by knowing how each looks, you can get an idea of what a graph might look like just by analyzing the function.
 The eight types are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
Different types of graphs depend on the type of function that is graphed.
 The eight most commonly used graphs are linear, power, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and sinusoidal.
 Each has a unique graph that is easy to visually differentiate from the rest.
