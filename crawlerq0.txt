A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs 
 The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator , a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered, but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate processor
 Some debuggers offer two modes of operation, full or partial simulation, to limit this impact
 For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory
 When the program  traps  or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the location in the original code if it is a source_level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly now seen in integrated development environments
 If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
 If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
 If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
 If it is a low_level debugger or a machine_language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly 
 Debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program step by step , stopping at some event or specified instruction by means of a breakpoint, and tracking the values of variables
 Some debuggers have the ability to modify program state while it is running
 It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error
 It often also makes it useful as a general verification tool, fault coverage, and performance analyzer, especially if instruction path lengths are shown
Most mainstream debugging engines, such as gdb and dbx, provide console_based command line interfaces
 Debugger front_ends are popular extensions to debugger engines that provide IDE integration, program animation, and visualization features
 These debuggers make it possible to step a program s execution backwards in time
 Various debuggers include this feature
NET, and some other languages, but not C  
 Some are open source  some are proprietary commercial software
 Some reverse debuggers slow down the target by orders of magnitude, but the best reverse debuggers cause a slowdown of 2  or less
 Reverse debugging is very useful for certain types of problems, but is still not commonly used yet
 For example, if the main target program is written in COBOL but calls assembly language subroutines and PL 1 subroutines, the debugger may have to dynamically switch modes to accommodate the changes in language as they occur
Most modern microprocessors have at least one of these features in their CPU design to make debugging easier
 Hardware support for single_stepping a program, such as the trap flag
 An instruction set that meets the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements makes it easier to write debugger software that runs on the same CPU as the software being debugged  such a CPU can execute the inner loops of the program under test at full speed, and still remain under debugger control

 JTAG access to hardware debug interfaces such as those on ARM architecture processors or using the Nexus command set
 Processors used in embedded systems typically have extensive JTAG debug support
 Micro controllers with as few as six pins need to use low pin_count substitutes for JTAG, such as BDM, Spy_Bi_Wire, or debugWIRE on the Atmel AVR
 Micro controllers with as few as six pins need to use low pin_count substitutes for JTAG, such as BDM, Spy_Bi_Wire, or debugWIRE on the Atmel AVR
 DebugWIRE, for example, uses bidirectional signaling on the RESET pin

The following sections describe debugger command programs
The following example uses the 
foreach token to search for WORD values of 5a4d
The following example uses the 
foreach token to search for WORD values of 5a4d
 For each 5a4d value that is found, the debugger displays 8 DWORD values, starting 4 bytes prior to the address where the 5a4d DWORD was found
Note If you want to operate on the variable name in the OutCommands portion of the command, you must add a space after the variable name
Note If you want to operate on the variable name in the OutCommands portion of the command, you must add a space after the variable name
 For example, in the preceeding example, there is a space between the variable place and the subtraction operator
 For example, in the preceeding example, there is a space between the variable place and the subtraction operator
The _ option together with the s command causes its output to include only the addresses it finds, not the values that are found at those addresses
The 1m option together with the lm command causes its output to include only the addresses of the modules, not the full description of the modules
The preceding example uses the      token to make sure aliases are replaced even if they are next to other text
 Note that the     token works on the variables that are used in 
 Note that the     token works on the variables that are used in 
foreach and on true aliases
 This command loads the whole file, replaces all carriage returns with semicolons, and executes the resulting block
 This command enables you to write readable programs by using multiple lines and indentation, instead of having to squeeze the whole program onto a single line
This example illustrates the following features
 The  t0,  t1, and  t2 pseudo_registers are used as variables in this program
 The program also uses aliases named Procc and  ImageName
 This program uses the MASM expression evaluator
 This token causes the program to use the C   expression evaluator to parse the expression within the parentheses
 This usage enables the program to use the C   structure tokens directly
 The   flag is used with the r command
The  t0,  t1, and  t2 pseudo_registers are used as variables in this program
 The program also uses aliases named Procc and  ImageName
This program uses the MASM expression evaluator
 This token causes the program to use the C   expression evaluator to parse the expression within the parentheses
 This usage enables the program to use the C   structure tokens directly
The   flag is used with the r command
This example illustrates the following features
 This program uses the MASM expression evaluator
 However, in two places, the   c  token appears
 This token causes the program to use the C   expression evaluator to parse the expression within the parentheses
 This usage enables the program to use C   structure tokens directly
 The   flag is used with the r command
 In the body of the loop,  t1 has the type ntdll _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY  , so the program can make direct member references
 In the body of the loop,  t1 has the type ntdll _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY  , so the program can make direct member references
 The user_named aliases  Base and  Mod are used in this program
 The dollar signs reduce the possibility that these aliases have been used previously in the current debugger session
 The dollar signs are not necessary
 The    v
   token interprets the alias literally, preventing it from being replaced if it was defined before the script is run
 The 
block token is used to add an extra alias replacement step
 Alias replacement occurs one time for the whole script when it is loaded and one time when each block is entered
 Without the 
block token and its braces, the 
echo command does not receive the values of the  Mod and  Base aliases that are assigned in the previous lines
This program uses the MASM expression evaluator
 However, in two places, the   c  token appears
 This token causes the program to use the C   expression evaluator to parse the expression within the parentheses
 This usage enables the program to use C   structure tokens directly
The   flag is used with the r command
 In the body of the loop,  t1 has the type ntdll _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY  , so the program can make direct member references

Errors can happen, every time you write some new computer code
Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose
Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen
 There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors
 There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors
 Searching for errors in programming code is called code debugging
Debugging is not easy
If your browser supports debugging, you can use console

In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code
In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code
At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values
After examining values, you can resume the execution of code 
The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls the debugging function

This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger
If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect

Debugging, in computer programming and engineering, is a multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem, and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it
 The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works

 Debugging is part of the software testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle

 Debugging is part of the software testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle
 The debugging process starts as soon as code is written and continues in successive stages as code is combined with other units of programming to form a software product
 In a large program that has thousands and thousands of lines of code, the debugging process can be made easier by using strategies such as unit tests, code reviews and pair programming

Once an error has been identified, it is necessary to actually find the error in the code
 At this point, it can be useful to look at the code s logging and use a stand_alone debugger tool or the debugging component of an integrated development environment 
 Invariably, the bugs in the functions that get most use are found and fixed first
 In some cases, the module that presents the problem is obvious, while the line of code itself is not
 In that case, unit tests __ such as JUnit and xUnit, which allow the programmer to run a specific function with specific inputs __ can be helpful in debugging

The standard practice is to set up a  breakpoint  and run the program until that breakpoint, at which time program execution stops
The standard practice is to set up a  breakpoint  and run the program until that breakpoint, at which time program execution stops
 The debugging component of an IDE typically provides the programmer with the capability to view memory and see variables, run the program to the next breakpoint, execute just the next line of code, and, in some cases, change the value of variables or even change the contents of the line of code about to be executed
Source code analyzers, which include security, common code errors and complexity analyzers, can also be helpful in debugging
 A complexity analyzer can find modules that are so intricate as to be hard to understand and test
 Other debugging tools include advanced logging and simulators that allow the programmer to model how an app on a mobile device will display and behave
Some tools, especially open source tools and scripting languages, do not run in an IDE and require a more manual approach to debugging
The use of the word bug as a synonym for error originated in engineering
 The term s application to computing and the inspiration for using the word debugging as a synonym for troubleshooting has been attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer programming, who was also known for her dry sense of humor
