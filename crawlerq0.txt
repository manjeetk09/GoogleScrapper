An algebraic function is a function that involves only algebraic operations, like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as fractional or rational exponents.
 Think of an algebraic function as a machine, where real numbers go in, mathematical operations occur, and other numbers come out.

 Think of an algebraic function as a machine, where real numbers go in, mathematical operations occur, and other numbers come out.
An algebraic function is a function which satisfies , where is a polynomial in and with integer coefficients.
 Functions that can be constructed using only a finite number of elementary operations together with the inverses of functions capable of being so constructed are examples of algebraic functions.
 Nonalgebraic functions are called transcendental functions.
