Erasure codes, which are also known as forward error correction codes, were developed more than 50 years ago.
 Different types have emerged since that time.
 In one of the earliest and most common types, Reed_Solomon, the data can be reconstructed using any combination of  k  symbols, or pieces of data, even if  m  symbols are lost or unavailable.
 For example, in EC 10 16, six drives, nodes or geographic locations could be lost or unavailable, and the original file would still be recoverable.

Professor Miller does research on erasure coding and how to use it in storage systems.
 In addition to his work at the university, Miller is a part_time employee at Pure Storage Inc.
, which sells enterprise solid_state storage arrays.
 Erasure coding is not the primary focus of his work at the company, and Pure Storage s products currently use no erasure coding beyond combinations of RAID 5 and RAID 6.

RAID, or Redundant Array of Independent Disks, is a familiar concept to most IT professionals.
 It s a way to spread data over a set of drives to prevent the loss of a drive causing permanent loss of data.
 RAID falls into two categories.
 Either a complete mirror image of the data is kept on a second drive  or parity blocks are added to the data so that failed blocks can be recovered.
