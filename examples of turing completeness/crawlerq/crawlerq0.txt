Here s the briefest explanation.
For example.
 Let s say there is a program that takes 10 numbers and adds them.
 Turing machine can easily run this program.
 But now imagine for some reason your programming language can t do the same addition then it s Turing machine incomplete.
 On the other hand, if it can run any program like the universal turing machine can run, then it s Turing complete.
An example of a Turing complete system is lambda calculus that was developed by Alonzo Church, Alan Turing s professor.
 Other examples of Turing complete systems include.
 Many procedural programming languages, including C and Pascal.
 Most object_oriented programming languages, such as Java and C  .
 Logic programming languages, such as Prolog.
 Many finite automata systems, such as Conway s Game of Life.

A programming language is said to be Turing_complete if it is in the same computational class as a Turing machine  that is to say, that it can perform any calculation that a universal Turing machine can.
 This is considered significant because, under the Church_Turing thesis, a Turing machine is the embodiment of the intuitive notion of an algorithm.

This is not the case when talking about a restricted set of computations.
 A finite_state automaton, for example, can be constructed which computes the Ackermann function ffor 1   m   1000 and 1   n   1000.
 In fact, such an evaluation could be stored in a million_cell lookup table.
