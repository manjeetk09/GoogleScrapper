0;Here s the briefest explanation.
0;For example.
0; Let s say there is a program that takes 10 numbers and adds them.
0; Turing machine can easily run this program.
0; But now imagine for some reason your programming language can t do the same addition then it s Turing machine incomplete.
0; On the other hand, if it can run any program like the universal turing machine can run, then it s Turing complete.
0;An example of a Turing complete system is lambda calculus that was developed by Alonzo Church, Alan Turing s professor.
0; Other examples of Turing complete systems include.
0; Many procedural programming languages, including C and Pascal.
0; Most object_oriented programming languages, such as Java and C  .
0; Logic programming languages, such as Prolog.
0; Many finite automata systems, such as Conway s Game of Life.

0;A programming language is said to be Turing_complete if it is in the same computational class as a Turing machine  that is to say, that it can perform any calculation that a universal Turing machine can.
0; This is considered significant because, under the Church_Turing thesis, a Turing machine is the embodiment of the intuitive notion of an algorithm.

0;This is not the case when talking about a restricted set of computations.
0; A finite_state automaton, for example, can be constructed which computes the Ackermann function ffor 1   m   1000 and 1   n   1000.
0; In fact, such an evaluation could be stored in a million_cell lookup table.
