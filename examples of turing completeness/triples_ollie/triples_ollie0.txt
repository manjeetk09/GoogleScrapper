 Let s say there is a program that takes 10 numbers and adds them.
0.54: (them; be adds by; a program that takes 10 numbers)

 Turing machine can easily run this program.

 But now imagine for some reason your programming language can t do the same addition then it s Turing machine incomplete.
0.668: (your programming language; can t do then; the same addition)
0.554: (it; s; Turing machine incomplete)

 On the other hand, if it can run any program like the universal turing machine can run, then it s Turing complete.
0.473: (any program; can be run on; the other hand)

A programming language is said to be Turing_complete if it is in the same computational class as a Turing machine  that is to say, that it can perform any calculation that a universal Turing machine can.
0.736: (A programming language; is said; Turing_complete)
0.647: (it; can perform; any calculation that a universal Turing machine can)
0.14: (it; is in; the same computational class)
0.079: (it; is as; a Turing machine)

 This is considered significant because, under the Church_Turing thesis, a Turing machine is the embodiment of the intuitive notion of an algorithm.
