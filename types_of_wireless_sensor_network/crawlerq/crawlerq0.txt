A Wireless Sensor Network is one kind of wireless network includes a large number of circulating, self_directed, minute, low powered devices named sensor nodes called motes.
 These networks certainly cover a huge number of spatially distributed, little, battery_operated, embedded devices that are networked to caringly collect, process, and transfer data to the operators, and it has controlled the capabilities of computing   processing.
 Nodes are the tiny computers, which work jointly to form the networks.
Wireless sensor networks , sometimes called wireless sensor and actuator networks , are spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc.
 and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location.
 The more modern networks are bi_directional, also enabling control of sensor activity.
 The development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance  today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, and so on.

The sensor networks for medical applications can be of several types.
 implanted, wearable, and environment_embedded.
 The implantable medical devices are those that are inserted inside human body.
 Wearable devices are used on the body surface of a human or just at close proximity of the user.
 Environment_embedded systems employ sensors contained in the environment.
 Possible applications include body position measurement, location of persons, overall monitoring of ill patients in hospitals and at homes.
 Devices embedded in the environment track the physical state of a person for continuous health diagnosis, using as input the data from a network of depth cameras, a sensing floor, or other similar devices.
 Body_area networks can collect information about an individual s health, fitness, and energy expenditure.
 In health care applications the privacy and authenticity of user data has prime importance.
 Especially due to the integration of sensor networks, with IoT, the authentication of user become more challenging  however, a solution is presented in recent work.

These types of networks consist of hundreds or thousands of wireless sensor nodes.
 These nodes can be deployed in an unstructured or a structured manner.
 The nodes are distributed randomly in an unstructured mode, but they are kept within the target area.

WSN nodes are typically organized in one of three types of network topologies.
 In a star topology, each node connects directly to a gateway.
 In a cluster tree network, each node connects to a node higher in the tree and then to the gateway, and data is routed from the lowest node on the tree to the gateway.
 Finally, to offer increased reliability, mesh networks feature nodes that can connect to multiple nodes in the system and pass data through the most reliable path available.
 This mesh link is often referred to as a router .
