Terrestrial WSNs are capable of communicating base stations efficiently, and consist of hundreds to thousands of wireless sensor nodes deployed either in unstructured or structured manner.
 In an unstructured mode, the sensor nodes are randomly distributed within the target area that is dropped from a fixed plane.
 The preplanned or structured mode considers optimal placement, grid placement, and 2D, 3D placement models.

The most common WSN architecture follows the OSI architecture Model.
 The architecture of the WSN includes five layers and three cross layers.
 Mostly in sensor n w we require five layers, namely application, transport, n w, data link   physical layer.
 The three cross planes are namely power management, mobility management, and task management.
 These layers of the WSN are used to accomplish the n w and make the sensors work together in order to raise the complete efficiency of the network.

 Types of wireless sensor networks and WSN topologies.
These types of networks consist of hundreds or thousands of wireless sensor nodes.
 These nodes can be deployed in an unstructured or a structured manner.
 The nodes are distributed randomly in an unstructured mode, but they are kept within the target area.

Wireless sensor networks , sometimes called wireless sensor and actuator networks , are spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc.
 and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location.
 The more modern networks are bi_directional, also enabling control of sensor activity.
 The development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance  today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, and so on.

The sensor networks for medical applications can be of several types.
 implanted, wearable, and environment_embedded.
 The implantable medical devices are those that are inserted inside human body.
 Wearable devices are used on the body surface of a human or just at close proximity of the user.
 Environment_embedded systems employ sensors contained in the environment.
 Possible applications include body position measurement, location of persons, overall monitoring of ill patients in hospitals and at homes.
 Devices embedded in the environment track the physical state of a person for continuous health diagnosis, using as input the data from a network of depth cameras, a sensing floor, or other similar devices.
 Body_area networks can collect information about an individual s health, fitness, and energy expenditure.
 In health care applications the privacy and authenticity of user data has prime importance.
 Especially due to the integration of sensor networks, with IoT, the authentication of user become more challenging  however, a solution is presented in recent work.

A sensor node, also known as a mote , is a node in a sensor network that is capable of performing some processing, gathering sensory information and communicating with other connected nodes in the network.
 A mote is a node but a node is not always a mote.

This chapter introduces wireless sensor networks , what are they as well as what types and applications exist.
 WSN consist of a few to thousands of sensor nodes, often also referred to as nodes or sensors, which sensor nodes are connected to each other via wireless communications.
 There are several assumptions or general properties of WSNs, which make them different from other types of wireless networks.
 There are many different applications of wireless sensor networks around the world making it impossible to cover all their application areas in the book.
 Applications of wireless sensor networks span environmental and animal monitoring, factory and industrial monitoring, agricultural monitoring and automation, health monitoring and many other areas.
 One of the main characteristics of wireless sensor networks is that they are tightly coupled with their application.
 The chapter explores the types of the WSN such as cyber_physical system , body sensor networks.
