Terrestrial WSNs are capable of communicating base stations efficiently, and consist of hundreds to thousands of wireless sensor nodes deployed either in unstructured (ad hoc) or structured (Preplanned) manner. In an unstructured mode, the sensor nodes are randomly distributed within the target area that is dropped from a fixed plane. The preplanned or structured mode considers optimal placement, grid placement, and 2D, 3D placement models.

Wireless sensor networks may comprise of numerous different types of sensors like low sampling rate, seismic, magnetic, thermal, visual, infrared, radar, and acoustic, which are clever to monitor a wide range of ambient situations. Sensor nodes are used for constant sensing, event ID, event detection & local control of actuators. The applications of wireless sensor network mainly include health, military, environmental, home, & other commercial areas.

The main characteristics of a WSN include: Power consumption constraints for nodes using batteries or energy harvesting. Ability to cope with node failures (resilience). Some mobility of nodes (for highly mobile nodes see MWSNs). Heterogeneity of nodes. Scalability to large scale of deployment. Ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Ease of use. Cross-layer design[14][15].
