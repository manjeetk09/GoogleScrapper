Terrestrial WSNs are capable of communicating base stations efficiently, and consist of hundreds to thousands of wireless sensor nodes deployed either in unstructured or structured manner.
0.893: (Terrestrial WSNs; consist of; hundreds)
0.74: (Terrestrial WSNs; are capable efficiently of; communicating base stations)

 In an unstructured mode, the sensor nodes are randomly distributed within the target area that is dropped from a fixed plane.
0.945: (the sensor nodes; are randomly distributed within; the target area that is dropped from a fixed plane)
0.754: (the sensor nodes; are randomly distributed in; an unstructured mode)

 The preplanned or structured mode considers optimal placement, grid placement, and 2D, 3D placement models.
