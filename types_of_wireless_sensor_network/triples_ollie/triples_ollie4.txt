 WSNs include a large number of sensor nodes, actuator nodes, gateways, and clients.
0.692: (WSNs; include; a large number of sensor nodes , actuator nodes , gateways , and clients)

 Recent progress in wireless technologies has facilitated the vast variety of uses of WSNs in the military, traffic observation, target tracking, environment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, and so on.
0.579: (Recent progress; has facilitated so on; the vast variety of uses of WSNs)
0.342: (Recent progress; has facilitated the vast variety of uses of WSNs so on in; the military , traffic observation)

 The designers of WSNs have been faced many new challenges, like sensed quantities, the size of nodes, and nodes  autonomy.
0.713: (The designers of WSNs; have been faced; many new challenges)

 As a result, improved solutions to these confront and perfections in the modern technologies are required.
0.542: (improved solutions; to confront as; a result)

 The prospect expansions in sensor nodes must construct very influential and expenditure effective devices so that they may be used in applications.
