Mobility models represent the movement of mobile user, and how their location, velocity and acceleration change over time.
0.773: (Mobility models; represent; the movement of mobile user)

 Such models are frequently used for simulation purposes when new communication or navigation techniques are investigated.
0.9: (Such models; are frequently used for; simulation purposes)

 Mobility management schemes for mobile communication systems make use of mobility models for predicting future user positions.
