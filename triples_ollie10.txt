Andrea Zanella   University of Padova Let me add to the suggestions of the colleagues a practical consideration  If your aim is to publish the results of your simulations in conferences or journals, I warmly suggest you to use well_known simulation paltforms, such as NS2, NS3 or OPNET, because reviewers are typically skeptical about home_made simulators  In case you opt for non_standard platforms, I suggest you to make your codes publicly available, so that people can check it out and verify that it is correct  I am pretty sure that reviewers will never spend their time to check whether or not your code is correct, but just the possibility to do that will strengthen your paper  Aug 3, 2012   Recommend 21 Recommendations.

Nirupama Bulusu   Portland State University When evaluating different simulators for wireless simulation, one of the questions you need to ask is   What is the level of detail that the simulator must capture to best understand the behavior of a particular network protocol   Depending on what you are evaluating, it may or may not be necessary to have detailed models of signal propagation, or an event_driven simulator that includes the medium access control layer etc  A couple of us documented our experiences in the following 2001 paper in the early days of wireless sensor network research, working on problems as diverse as localization, directed diffusion, robot following and wireless visualization  Although 12 years old, you might find the guidelines useful as you evaluate different simulators  John Heidemann, Nirupama Bulusu, Jeremy Elson, Chalermek Intanagonwiwat, Kun_chan Lan, Ya Xu, Wei Ye, Deborah Estrin, and Ramesh Govindan  Effects of Detail in Wireless Network Simulation  In Proceedings of the SCS Multiconference on Distributed Simulation, pp  3_11  Phoenix, Arizona, USA, USC Information Sciences Institute, Society for Computer Simulation  January, 2001   http   www isi edu  johnh PAPERS Heidemann01a html    Abstract  Experience with wired networks has provides guidance about what level of detail is appropriate for simulation_based protocol studies  Wireless simulations raise many new questions about appropriate levels of detail in simulation models for radio propagation and energy consumption  This paper describes the trade_offs associated with adding detail to simulation models  We evaluate the effects of detail in five case studies of wireless simulations for protocol design  Ultimately the researcher must judge what level of detail is required for a given question, but we suggest two approaches to cope with varying levels of detail  When error is not correlated, networking algorithms that are robust to a range of errors are often stressed in similar ways by random error as by detailed models  We also suggest visualization techniques that can help pinpoint incorrect details and manage detail overload  Nov 20, 2013   Recommend 1 Recommendation.

Mehdi Hedayatpour   Yazd University With the development of embedded system and network technology, there has been growing interest in providing fine_grained metering and controlling of living environments using low power devices  Wireless Sensor Networks , which consist of spatially distributed self_configurable sensors, perfectly meet the requirement  The sensors provide the ability to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, vibration, pressure, sound, motion and etc, with very low energy consumption  The sensors also have the ability to transmit and forward sensing data to the base station  Most modern WSNs are bi_directional, enabling two_way communication, which could collect sensing data from sensors to the base station as well as disseminate commands from base station to end sensors  The development of WSNs was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance  WSNs are widely used in industrial environments, residential environments and wildlife environments  Structure health monitoring, healthcare applications, home automation, and animal tracking become representative WSNs applications  A typical Wireless Sensor Network is built of several hundreds or even thousands of  sensor nodes   The topology of WSNs can vary among star network, tree network, and mesh network  Each node has the ability to communication with every other node wirelessly, thus a typical sensor node has several components  a radio transceiver with an antenna which has the ability to send or receive packets, a microcontroller which could process the data and schedule relative tasks, several kinds of sensors sensing the environment data, and batteries providing energy supply  A sensor node might vary in size  The  Smart dust   SmartDust  sensor node, shown in Figure 1, from Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at University of California Berkeley, is smaller than a coin  The cost of sensor nodes is similarly variable depending on the quality of onboard chips  One of the main challenges in WSNs is to decrease the cost and size  There are an increasing number of small companies producing WSN hardwires  The most popular two are TelosB sensor node, shown in Figure 2, from Crossbow Technology  TelosB  and Tmote Sky sensor node, shown in Figure 3, from Sentilla  TmoteSky   Operating systems for WSN nodes are much less complex than general_purpose operating systems  This is because WSN usually deployed with a particular purpose and low power microcontrollers cannot afford complicated computing  TinyOS is the most popular operating system specifically designed for wireless sensor networks  TinyOS is based on an event_driven architecture using NesC programming language  Simulator is universally used to develop and test protocols of WSNs, especially in the beginning stage of these designs  The cost of simulating thousands of nodes networks is very low, and the simulation can be finished within very short execution time  Both general and specialized simulators are available for uses to simulate WSNs  The tool, which is using firmware as well as hardware to perform the simulation, is called emulator  Imran10   Emulation can combine both software and hardware implementation  Emulator implements in real nodes, thus it may provide more precision performance  Usually emulator has highly scalability, which can emulate numerous sensor nodes at the same time  Mar 20, 2014   Recommend 1 Recommendation.

Nirupama Bulusu   Portland State University When evaluating different simulators for wireless simulation, one of the questions you need to ask is   What is the level of detail that the simulator must capture to best understand the behavior of a particular network protocol   Depending on what you are evaluating, it may or may not be necessary to have detailed models of signal propagation, or an event_driven simulator that includes the medium access control layer etc  A couple of us documented our experiences in the following 2001 paper in the early days of wireless sensor network research, working on problems as diverse as localization, directed diffusion, robot following and wireless visualization  Although 12 years old, you might find the guidelines useful as you evaluate different simulators  John Heidemann, Nirupama Bulusu, Jeremy Elson, Chalermek Intanagonwiwat, Kun_chan Lan, Ya Xu, Wei Ye, Deborah Estrin, and Ramesh Govindan  Effects of Detail in Wireless Network Simulation  In Proceedings of the SCS Multiconference on Distributed Simulation, pp  3_11  Phoenix, Arizona, USA, USC Information Sciences Institute, Society for Computer Simulation  January, 2001   http   www isi edu  johnh PAPERS Heidemann01a html    Abstract  Experience with wired networks has provides guidance about what level of detail is appropriate for simulation_based protocol studies  Wireless simulations raise many new questions about appropriate levels of detail in simulation models for radio propagation and energy consumption  This paper describes the trade_offs associated with adding detail to simulation models  We evaluate the effects of detail in five case studies of wireless simulations for protocol design  Ultimately the researcher must judge what level of detail is required for a given question, but we suggest two approaches to cope with varying levels of detail  When error is not correlated, networking algorithms that are robust to a range of errors are often stressed in similar ways by random error as by detailed models  We also suggest visualization techniques that can help pinpoint incorrect details and manage detail overload  Nov 20, 2013   Recommend 1 Recommendation.

Mehdi Hedayatpour   Yazd University With the development of embedded system and network technology, there has been growing interest in providing fine_grained metering and controlling of living environments using low power devices  Wireless Sensor Networks , which consist of spatially distributed self_configurable sensors, perfectly meet the requirement  The sensors provide the ability to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, vibration, pressure, sound, motion and etc, with very low energy consumption  The sensors also have the ability to transmit and forward sensing data to the base station  Most modern WSNs are bi_directional, enabling two_way communication, which could collect sensing data from sensors to the base station as well as disseminate commands from base station to end sensors  The development of WSNs was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance  WSNs are widely used in industrial environments, residential environments and wildlife environments  Structure health monitoring, healthcare applications, home automation, and animal tracking become representative WSNs applications  A typical Wireless Sensor Network is built of several hundreds or even thousands of  sensor nodes   The topology of WSNs can vary among star network, tree network, and mesh network  Each node has the ability to communication with every other node wirelessly, thus a typical sensor node has several components  a radio transceiver with an antenna which has the ability to send or receive packets, a microcontroller which could process the data and schedule relative tasks, several kinds of sensors sensing the environment data, and batteries providing energy supply  A sensor node might vary in size  The  Smart dust   SmartDust  sensor node, shown in Figure 1, from Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at University of California Berkeley, is smaller than a coin  The cost of sensor nodes is similarly variable depending on the quality of onboard chips  One of the main challenges in WSNs is to decrease the cost and size  There are an increasing number of small companies producing WSN hardwires  The most popular two are TelosB sensor node, shown in Figure 2, from Crossbow Technology  TelosB  and Tmote Sky sensor node, shown in Figure 3, from Sentilla  TmoteSky   Operating systems for WSN nodes are much less complex than general_purpose operating systems  This is because WSN usually deployed with a particular purpose and low power microcontrollers cannot afford complicated computing  TinyOS is the most popular operating system specifically designed for wireless sensor networks  TinyOS is based on an event_driven architecture using NesC programming language  Simulator is universally used to develop and test protocols of WSNs, especially in the beginning stage of these designs  The cost of simulating thousands of nodes networks is very low, and the simulation can be finished within very short execution time  Both general and specialized simulators are available for uses to simulate WSNs  The tool, which is using firmware as well as hardware to perform the simulation, is called emulator  Imran10   Emulation can combine both software and hardware implementation  Emulator implements in real nodes, thus it may provide more precision performance  Usually emulator has highly scalability, which can emulate numerous sensor nodes at the same time  Mar 20, 2014   Recommend 1 Recommendation.
